  <h2 class='c005'><b>CHAPTER I.</b><br /> <br /><i>Brother and Sister—Forebodings—Nettleton.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>War!</span> Oh! how much of misery is expressed
in that one word! It tells its own
tale of woe, of blood, of broken hearts and
desolated homes, of hopes blighted, of poverty
and crime, of plunder, peculation and
official tyranny, of murder and sudden death.
In short, it develops all the baser passions
of the human heart, changing a peaceful
world to a world of woe, over which the
destroying angel well might weep.</p>

<p class='c007'>Come, oh, thou angel, <span class='sc'>Peace</span>!</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Army of the Mississippi,” as it was
termed, had been unsuccessful in their pursuit
of the rebel General Price. A portion
of it, or rather the division commanded by
General Sigel, had advanced from Springfield,
Missouri, upon the Wilson creek road,
as far as the famous battle-ground rendered
immortal by the death of General Lyon, but
finding no enemy, it had encamped upon
Grand Prairie, a few miles to the west of
the bloody field. All in camp was upon
the “tip-toe of expectation.” The lovely
scene spread out before the view, was sufficient
to inspire the heart of man to great
and glorious deeds. The broad, rolling
prairie lay there, like heaven’s great carpet.
The long grass waved in the breeze, presenting
the appearance of a deep-green sea,
undulating in low swells as if Queen Mab’s
wand were wafting over it; the autumn’s
frost had changed thousands of the delicate
emerald blades to purple, yellow, and scarlet,
while, intermixed with these, was the white
prairie flower, lending to the scene an
almost fairy-like aspect. The large “Fremont”
tents were arranged in rows, in a
tasty manner; flags were flying; bands
were discoursing sweet strains which echoed
far and wide; squads of soldiers in vari-colored
uniforms were lounging lazily on the
grass, while those detailed for mess or guard
duty, were busily prosecuting their assigned
tasks. To the east of the camp appeared a
wall of forest-kings, their verdure, also,
touched by the frost, presenting a variety
of colors, and glistening in the sunlight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Few in that small army had witnessed the
horrors of the battle-field; but, like all “green”
troops, conceiving that there was much of
romance connected with the deadly field,
and that heroes were created by a single
brave deed, the mass of Sigel’s men were
eager to meet the foe. It had been given
out that the entire army was to join this
division on the prairies, and that an advance
was to be made at once against Price, who
was then at Cassville, some forty miles distant,
to the southward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think we can safely count upon a desperate
battle by the day after to-morrow,”
exclaimed one of a party of five, seated within
a captain’s tent—four of whom were at a
table, with cups and wine before them. The
fifth person was making himself generally
useful, acting in the capacity of a servant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have fleshed your maiden sword at
Springfield, and I did not suppose you would
be anxious for another fight. I confess I
can not gaze upon such scenes without a
shudder, and, if duty would permit, I would
willingly sheathe my sword forever.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Captain Hayward, you are low-spirited
to-day,” answered the first speaker.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am, indeed, Lieutenant Wells. And
can you wonder? My sister is here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I only wish mine was!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is a rash wish, my friend. She
would be exposed to much danger, and I
never want mine to gaze upon a battle-field.
No! where <i>men</i> cut each other’s throats,
delicate, sensitive women should not be
near!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Could you find no way in which to send
her from Springfield to St. Louis?” asked
Wells.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could have done so by the mail coach
but, you know, the entire distance of one
hundred and thirty miles, from Springfield
to Rolla, or to Tipton upon the other route,
is infested with guerrillas, and I feared to
send her. I preferred she should brave the
dangers of the camp or even the battle-field
with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Hayward bent his head upon his
hands and was silent. It was some moments
before any one ventured to speak. All appeared
to be oppressed with a strange sadness.
At length one of the party, Captain
Gilbert, slapping him familiarly upon the
shoulder, and endeavoring to speak gayly,
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, come, Harry, this won’t do! you
must shake off every vestige of blues. You
are suffering still from the wound you received
in the Warsaw skirmish, and it makes
you low-spirited. No doubt your sister will
be perfectly safe, and I know she had much
rather be with you, to assist you should you
need her aid, than to be safe in St. Louis,
enduring the tortures of suspense.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hayward made no reply. At this moment,
a female, delicate and fair, came tripping
lightly into the tent, her face wreathed
in smiles, and her eyes sparkling with delight;
but, as she caught sight of Hayward,
she paused, and gazed upon him for a moment,
exhibiting the most intense interest;
then advancing, and placing her hand upon
his shoulder, she spoke:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Brother!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hayward started, and clasping her in his
arms, he pressed her close to his heart for a
moment. But, gazing into his eyes, she
asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is the matter, dear Harry, you appear
ill?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The countenance of Hayward underwent
an instant change, as he replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not ill, but somewhat depressed in
spirits, perhaps, in view of what a day may
bring forth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! Harry,” she said, “I hear there is
going to be another fight. Will <i>you</i> have
to go into it and leave me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Should there be a battle, I shall endeavor
to protect you, dear sister.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, you will be in danger; perhaps
wounded—perhaps killed! Oh! what <i>would</i>
I do, then? Don’t go, Harry!” and the gentle
girl threw her arms around her brother’s
neck and wept. After a moment, he raised
her, and pressing his lips to her forehead,
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish to speak with these gentlemen a
moment. Go to your friend Alibamo’s
tent. I will come for you, soon!” The
sister cast back a look of fond solicitude, and
left the tent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hayward gazed after her a moment, muttering
audibly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor child, what <i>would</i> you do if I
should fall. You would indeed be alone!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, captain, I don’t think that’s half
fair,” exclaimed the one spoken of as being
the servant. “Do you think I am such a
darn skunk as to—if you was killed—the
darn—not to fight for my capt’n’s sister—the
skunk—no, I mean, if you die—if she—darn
me, if I don’t—I—I—” and the
speaker, as if unable to express what he <i>did</i>
mean, suddenly left the tent. All present
smiled broadly, and good-humor was thus,
for the moment, infused in all hearts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nettleton had a sudden call!” said one.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He has gone to the sutler for a dictionary!”
added another.</p>

<p class='c007'>“His heart is in the right place,” remarked
Hayward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s so!” responded all, with emphasis.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are safe, with such a ‘darn skunk’
for your body-guard, Captain Hayward,”
Gilbert declared, with comic seriousness.</p>

<p class='c007'>William Nettleton was in height about six
feet. His general appearance was very singular.
His hair was nearly white—naturally
so; his eyes of a light green and
large; his carriage very loose—indeed, when
he walked, one would almost expect to see
him fall in pieces. His feet were huge in
dimensions. He had the appearance of a
half-witted, illy-formed person; but he was,
withal, neither one nor the other. Having
been detached from the company to which
he belonged, to act as servant to Captain
Hayward, he soon became so greatly attached
and devoted to the captain, as to be
styled his “body-guard.” This attachment
was not fictitious, nor did it proceed from
a spirit of military sycophancy or subserviency;
it was felt. Nettleton had evinced
more than ordinary courage on several occasions,
and had, also, displayed so much
judgment with his intrepidity, that he had
received offers of advancement; but these
he declined, preferring, as he expressed
himself, “to stay with my capt’n, the first
what promoted me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It will also be well to explain the presence
of ladies in the camp. Miss Mamie
Hayward was the sister of Captain Hayward,
who, having received intelligence that
her brother was wounded, had visited Springfield
for the purpose of ministering to his
wants. At the time of her arrival Fremont’s
“Army of the Mississippi” was marching
upon that place, and the journey from Rolla
or Tipton was safe. But soon, those roads
were infested with guerrillas, and, as they
were poorly guarded, it was not thought
prudent that the ladies who had reached
Springfield should attempt a return. Miss
Hayward, therefore, remained with her brother.
This same reason will apply to all
the ladies in camp, of which there were
several—conspicuous among whom was the
wife of Adjutant Hinton, one of the officers
of the well-known “Benton Cadets.” She
was usually addressed as “Alibamo”—her
name when a captive in Price’s hands. She
was very beautiful, and of that daring, determined
nature which has immortalized so
many women of the West. In company with
Alibamo, was a young lady who acted in
the capacity of waiting-maid, but who really
appeared more like a companion. This female
possessed the not particularly euphonious
name of Sally Long.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must join with Nettleton in my reproaches,
Captain Hayward,” answered
Lieutenant Wells, in a subdued tone. “You
forget my conversation with you last night!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Wells. You informed me of your
affection for my sister, but you have never
addressed her as a lover. How do you
know that she will return your love? If
she could return it, I confess, lieutenant, I
do not know any one to whom I would
more willingly see her united; but, if she
can not, how could you assume to become
her protector?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If such should be the case, and the fortunes
of war should deprive her of a brother,
rest assured that, not only myself, but
every man in camp would willingly shed
his blood in her defense, and care for her as
a sister!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you. I <i>do</i> feel a foreboding of
evil. I believe I shall be killed in the coming
battle. If this should be the case, I
commend her to your care. But, my nerves
are excited. I will walk into the open air.
No! I would be alone!” he added, as one
of the officers arose as if to accompany him.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he left the tent one of the party, a
Captain Walker, exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I hope things are all right, but I
have my doubts!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your doubts of what?” asked Wells.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Humph! well, no matter. <i>You</i> are too
directly interested to listen to the explanation.
But, perhaps you will find out some
day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you intend, sir, to cast any slur upon
Captain Hayward?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Walker did not reply, but left the
tent. An hour or more had passed, and
Hayward did not return. It was now quite
dark, when suddenly the assembly was
sounded, and, all anxious, the troops fell in.
The order was read:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pack knapsacks, and have every thing
in readiness for a move at daylight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>All was excitement, and every preparation
was made for a forward movement.
But soon it began to be whispered that the
orders were to return. In a short time it
was officially announced that the movement
was, in reality, <i>back to Springfield</i>, and from
thence to Rolla and St. Louis. Many were
the expressions of disappointment and regret,
and some even ventured to denounce
the policy. Fremont had been superseded
in the field, and General Hunter, his successor,
had abandoned the campaign, then
on the very eve of its final consummation.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><b>CHAPTER II.</b><br /> <br /><i>The Tragedy of the Stream. Who was Guilty?</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>When</span> Captain Hayward left the tent, he
proceeded to the stream which skirted the
woods. Bending over it, he bathed his fevered
brow. Then he seated himself upon
the bank of the river, and, resting his head
upon his hands, was, for a long time, absorbed
in his thoughts. A human form
flitted lightly past. Hayward raised his
head and listened, but all was quiet again,
and, in the darkness of the night he could
distinguish nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was mistaken!” he said to himself.
“If I was not, and a human being is around,
I will wager it was Nettleton, who, anxious
for my safety, has followed me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The captain was again silent for a moment,
when the breaking of a twig betrayed
the presence of some person. Hayward
raised his head and called:</p>

<p class='c007'>“William! William Nettleton!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir!” answered a voice but a few feet
from the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why did you follow me, William?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cos I’m a darn skunk,” drawled the
person addressed, as he emerged out of the
darkness. “And——<i>Curse you</i>!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The person speaking was before him. In
an instant Hayward sprung to his feet, but,
with a cry of agony exclaimed: “Great
God, Nettleton—why have you—oh God,
save me—you’ve killed me—I die!” And,
falling heavily forward, the words died upon
his tongue.</p>

<p class='c007'>The murderer bent over the murdered
for a moment; then, with some haste, rolled
the body into the water, and turned from
the spot. He paused under the shade of
a tree, and listened for the tread of a sentry,
that he might enter the camp unobserved.
With a half-suppressed laugh he uttered his
thoughts:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have done it, sure; and now that it
is done, I must progress—no retreating now.
I think I’ll win. Good-by, captain, and give
my respects to my friends as you float downstream.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He proceeded with caution toward the
camp, and was soon lost in the city of canvas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tattoo soon sounded. Lights were
extinguished, and all was quiet, save in a
few tents, which appeared to be those of
officers. Yet, there were aching hearts
within that camp, and, as the night progressed,
many were the anxious inquiries as
to why Captain Hayward did not return.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a large tent, near that occupied by
Captain Hayward, were seated three ladies.
One was Miss Hayward; another was Alibamo,
or, as she is now a wife, she should
be called Mrs. Adjutant Hinton; the other
was Miss Sally Long, the waiting-maid of
Alibamo. Before this tent paced a special
guard; beside it was a tent of much smaller
dimensions, occupied by Nettleton and <i>his</i>
servant, black George, or, as Nettleton used
to call him, “Swasey’s nigger.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I fear something has befallen my brother.
He does not return, and it is now
twelve o’clock!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t be alarmed,” said Alibamo, in a
soothing voice; “your brother is most
likely at the head-quarters of General Sigel.
He may be detained on business. Come,
let us retire.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not while my brother is absent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment the guard came to the
tent entrance and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ladies, if you have not yet retired Captain
Walker requests the pleasure of a few
words with Miss Hayward.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Alibamo, I fear that man; he looks
at me so strangely. But perhaps he brings
news of my brother. I will see him. Bid
the captain enter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As Walker entered he appeared agitated,
but controlling his emotions, he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ladies, you will pray excuse me. I
feel that I <i>must</i> speak now, as it may be my
last opportunity. We—or, I should say the
army—will be separated at Springfield, and
I shall see you no more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you bring news of my brother?”
asked Miss Hayward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! His disappearance is very strange.
But I came to speak of myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What would you say?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This, Miss Hayward. I have loved you
long and dearly. To-morrow we may be
parted, and I would ask you, should the
fortunes, or rather the misfortunes, of war
deprive you of a brother’s love and protection,
will you not permit me to seek you
out and become your future protector?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Captain Walker, these words surprise
me, and I think propriety demanded that
they should have been spoken in the presence
of my brother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pardon me, dear lady. I have waited
until this hour for your brother’s return, and
at last, fearing I should have no other opportunity,
I ventured to visit you now. You
have a friend and sister in Alibamo, and
surely you will not fear to speak before her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can not answer your question—it refers
to the future.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then for the <i>present</i>. Let me speak
plainly, and I beg you will do the same.
Can you not at least regard me <i>now</i> as your
friend and protector, and give me a friend’s
privileges?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The timid girl turned toward Alibamo,
and in an inaudible voice, spoke a word.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She answers promptly, <i>no</i>!” replied
Alibamo, somewhat sterner than was her
usual manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You <i>love</i> another, then?” asked Walker.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Hayward did not reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is the favored one Lieutenant Wells?”
again asked Walker.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are impertinent, Captain Walker,”
replied Alibamo. “I must request you to
retire. How can you thus, in her brother’s
absence, address her in this manner?”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment there was a commotion
in the tent of Nettleton. The voice of the
negro was heard, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I he’rd you, massa Nettleton. There
ain’t no use in you denyin’ it. I he’rd
massa cap’n say, ‘Oh, Nettleton, ye kill me!’
Oh Lord, if eber I get out ob <i>dis</i> scrape,
ye’ll neber catch dis chile in such another
one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is the nigger crazy? What is the
darn skunk talking about?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you needn’t make b’lieve ignoramus
on dis ’ere question. I he’rd ye.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, look a here, you unconscionable
dark; if you have got any thing to say,
spit it out. Don’t make a darn skunk of
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! won’t I fotch ye up in de morning?
Yes, sah!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you going to speak, and say what
you mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, golly! You go back on de cap’n
dat way!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What cap’n? Out with it, or I’ll
break your head and every bone in your
body,” exclaimed Nettleton, in a state of
undisguised excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Serve dis nigger as ye did de cap’n,
and den put his body in de riber!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The negro had scarcely uttered these
words when Nettleton seized him. He set
up a terrible howl, which brought Captain
Walker to their tent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is all this fuss about?” asked
Walker.</p>

<p class='c007'>The negro went on to explain as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, ye see, massa cap’n, I went ober
to dat yar house across de riber, to see Miss
Julia, a col’d gal dat used to be my sweetheart.
Well, I see’d de Johnnies comin’,
and I ran down to de riber to come on dis
side, but dey come so close to me dat dis
chile hid behind a big log. Den dey stop
right by me, and say, ‘Golly, we can’t
cotch nobody.’ Den I he’rd some one on
de oder side ob de riber say, “Oh, Nettleton,
you—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Silence this stuff! You have been
drunk. If you speak upon this subject
again, I’ll cut your black throat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’se dumb, massa cap’n.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Quiet had now been restored, and all
parties retired for the few hours that intervened
before morning. But it was evident
all were not asleep. Several times a stealthy
step was heard, and a shadow flitted past
the white canvas tent, dimly seen by the
pale starlight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning came at last, and all was astir.
Captain Hayward had not yet returned.
The inquiry was made if any one had seen
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have not seen him since last evening
at twilight,” replied Walker, “at which time
he acted very strangely, and talked about
the injustice of war. I am inclined to
think he has deserted and joined the enemy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you darn skunk!” yelled Nettleton,
as he sprang forward, and was about to
strike the speaker. But, checking himself,
he added: “It’s well you wear them gilt
things on your shoulders, or I’d teach you
to call <i>my</i> cap’n such names.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you would save yourself trouble you
had better remain quiet, Nettleton,” replied
Walker, as he fixed his eyes significantly
upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>I</i> knows where Cap’n Hayward am,”
said the negro, stepping forward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is he?” sobbed Miss Hayward,
pressing forward, in her eagerness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Silence!” yelled Walker.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let him speak,” said the colonel. “Go
on, George. Where is the captain?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Down dar!” The negro trembled violently,
and glanced at Nettleton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s in de riber—killed dead, sure!”</p>

<p class='c007'>A wild shriek rose upon the air as Miss
Hayward fell back into the arms of Alibamo,
insensible.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By whom was he killed?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By massa Nettleton dar, <i>sure</i>. I he’rd
across de riber, jis as plain as day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton started back in horror, his eyes
extending widely, and his frame trembling.
A general murmur of disbelief ran through
the crowd.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you <i>see</i> him do the deed?” asked
the colonel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Golly, I couldn’t see much, it war so
dark. But I hear massa cap’n say, ‘Oh,
Nettleton, you kill me!’ Golly, see how
massa Nettleton shake!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where was this?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rite down by dat tree. His blood is
all ober de ground; I jest see it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In an instant Nettleton had dashed off
for the spot indicated. In accordance with
an order from the colonel he was pursued.
Reaching the locality named, he gazed upon
the ground. It was red with blood—fresh
blood. He threw himself upon the earth,
and wept and moaned, and called upon his
captain to return. His grief was terrible
to behold. By this time the officers and
many of the men had arrived. They gazed
upon the grief-stricken servant with respect,
and more than one expression of sympathy
was heard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If Captain Hayward has been murdered,
it was not by that boy. Nettleton loved
his captain too much to harm him,” said
Lieutenant Wells. “I am inclined to think
the deed has been done by skulking guerrillas.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I incline to your opinion, Lieutenant
Wells, as to the innocence of Nettleton.
But, as to the deed having been done by
guerrillas, it is not likely. It is much too
near camp.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But Hayward certainly had no enemy
in our camp who would have done this
deed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We do not know the secret motives
which animate the human heart,” replied
Walker, in a tone and manner not devoid
of meaning.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let instant search be made for the body,”
commanded the colonel. It was done, but
no trace of it could be found, although the
water was too shallow to have permitted it
to float down the river. Attention was
again directed to Nettleton, who was sitting
erect, gazing at a piece of sharp, bloody
steel which he held in his hand. Viewing
it a moment, he sprung to his feet, and fixed
his eyes upon Lieutenant Wells. Then he
turned to the colonel and handed him the
blade. That officer examined it. Directing
his gaze upon Lieutenant Wells, he asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Has any one among you a small Spanish
dirk, with a highly-polished and ornamented
blade?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I <i>had</i> such a one,” replied Wells, “but
I have missed it for several days.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The colonel instantly turned toward the
camp, commanding all to follow him. He
halted before the tent of Lieutenant Wells,
and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You, Captain Walker, and you, Adjutant
Hinton, enter this tent, and tell me
what you find.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The search lasted but a moment, during
which time Wells had been assisting Miss
Hayward, but not without evincing much
agitation. Walker now appeared, holding
in his hand a bowl of bloody water, and
exhibiting the broken stiletto, covered with
blood, which had been found in the overcoat
pocket of Wells. A shirt, also, was
found, which was stained with blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What can you say to this damning
proof of your guilt?” asked the colonel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know nothing of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Arrest the murderer of Captain Harry
Hayward!” commanded the colonel, in a
loud voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The guards instantly seized him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Murderer! <i>He</i> a murderer—and of
my brother! No! no! This is some dreadful
dream. Oh, tell me my brother is not
murdered; it will kill me. Oh, see! Pity
a friendless girl who kneels to you and begs
you to tell her that you have <i>not</i> deprived
her of a dear brother. Speak to me, Edward.
I did love you, and you would not
harm him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wells could not speak. He had never
spoken to Miss Hayward of his love for
her; but <i>now</i>, in the delirium of her grief,
she had confessed her love for him. Oh,
what a moment!</p>

<p class='c007'>Walker advanced to raise Miss Hayward
from her bended position before Wells.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Paws off, ye darn skunk!” yelled Nettleton,
as he hurled Walker to the ground.
“<i>I</i> alone am her protector now.”</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><b>CHAPTER III.</b><br /> <br /><i>The Proposal—The Interruption—The Indian<br />—The Rescue—The Wounded Man—The Mystery.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Near</span> the village of Ozark, at the base of
a ridge of mountains of that name, runs a
most beautiful stream or river, which bears
the name of the village, and is one of the
tributaries of the north fork of the Gasconade.
Its banks are high, and covered with
a thick but small growth of the “scrub”
oak, peculiar to that portion of Missouri.
The bed of the river sparkles with brilliant
white and yellow pebbles, polished by the
rush of waters for thousands of years. A
fine bridge spans the stream along the main
road, that runs through the only opening
in the forest for miles around. After crossing
this bridge, and ascending a sharp hill,
the village of Ozark is reached. This consists
of about twenty ordinary-looking dwellings,
a court-house, and a rough building,
dignified by the name hotel. Beyond the
village, and higher up the mountain, is a
line of rolling hills, which overlook the
country for miles around. On one of these,
and near the edge of a grove, were to be
seen a cluster of tents, and, from the number
of horses picketed but a short distance
away, it would at once be supposed, from
a distance, to be a cavalry camp, with, perhaps,
a section of artillery.</p>

<p class='c007'>On a sloping point, extending from the
side of the bridge to the stream, and reclining
upon the turf, were two persons. The
one a young man of marked appearance,
and the other a female of much beauty, although
her dress bespoke her a native of
that portion of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nettie, when do you expect your sister
to return?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is difficult to answer, Charles, but I
trust very soon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you not heard from her recently?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. There is no way in which she can
communicate with me. The mails have
been discontinued, you are aware, from Rolla
to Springfield.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you can <i>visit</i> the army, I presume you
can both dispatch and receive letters. Are
you not very anxious to learn how she is
treated among the Federals?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am most anxious; still I have no fears.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can not feel as you do upon that subject.
I would not awaken useless fears in
your breast, but <i>I</i> have not so much confidence
in their magnanimous natures.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Charles, you told me to-day for the first
time, that you loved me, and asked me if I
could not address you as <i>dear</i> Charles. You
have been very kind to me, and, on one occasion,
you rescued me from the hands of a
villain. I feel grateful—truly so. But,
whatever my feelings may be, I never can
wed my country’s enemy. Look yonder.
You see that white cottage. Once it was
beautifully adorned with creeping vines, and
the lawn before it bloomed with flowers and
shrubbery. But, dearer than all, within its
walls lived my father and my sister. Look
at it now! Its beauty has departed—it is a
<i>wreck</i>; father and sister have been driven
from it, while I have been detained here by
<i>force</i>. You profess to love me. If you do
so, <i>prove it</i>! We are now more than a mile
from the rebel camp, and you can escape
with me to Springfield.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will assist <i>you</i> to escape; indeed, I will
accompany you a portion of the way to
Springfield. But <i>I</i> must return to my own
people and fight with them to the last. I
<i>do</i> love you, and I <i>would</i> become your husband,
gladly, if I could be satisfied you
loved me for myself alone. But, I can not
sacrifice one jot of honor or principle to win
even you, dear Nettie.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you will go with me, now?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes—stay, what is that? Did you not
hear a low, moaning sound?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I heard nothing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, perhaps I am mistaken. But I
fancied I heard such a sound. No matter.
I will go with you now to Springfield.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To what purpose, young man?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The speaker was a powerful person, and
had emerged from the bridge just in time to
hear the last sentence of Charles Campbell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So, sir,” he continued, “you would desert
us, and join the Yankees, and all for
your foolish regard for this vixen!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Colonel Price, if you were not an officer
I would make you <i>eat</i> your words. I have
served you faithfully, and you have no right
to question my loyalty. I do <i>not</i> intend to
desert, neither is this lady a <i>vixen</i> any more
than you are a <i>coward</i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Price started, bit his lips, and frowned
fiercely. At length he asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why did you propose visiting Springfield
with this——lady?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I intended to accompany her a portion
of the way, and then to return to my duty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why does <i>she</i> wish to visit Springfield?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because her father and sister are both in
St. Louis, and she wishes to rejoin them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did not yonder cottage belong to her
father?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was one of the most bitter opposers
in this section. And you love his abolition
daughter?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I love his <i>daughter</i>, sir!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Enough. You will return to camp this
moment. I will take charge of this young
lady. When I rejoin you, I shall put your
loyalty and your <i>courage</i> to the test. Do
you see yonder boat?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He pointed up the river. A small boat
was seen floating down the stream, in which
three men were sitting erect, and the form
of a fourth, lying prostrate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you propose testing my loyalty,
Colonel Price?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That boat contains a Yankee officer.
He is to be hung up by the neck. You shall
perform the job.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is not that man <i>wounded</i>, Colonel
Price?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, very badly so, I am informed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Then I will not perform the base thing you
propose.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>Price drew a revolver, and pointing it to
the head of Campbell, commanded him to
start at once for camp. He had scarcely
done so, when a powerful Indian sprung
from concealment, and snatched the weapon
from his hand. At the same time he seized
Price, as if he had been a child, and hurled
him into the water below. Without waiting
to watch the result of this sudden immersion
upon the chivalrous colonel, he caught the
maiden in his arms, and bounded off in the
direction of Springfield. As he started, he
beckoned to the young man and muttered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come—follow—me save her!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Price floundered about in the water for a
moment, and finally succeeded in reaching
the shore just as the boat came up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come—quick—join me in the pursuit!”
yelled Price.</p>

<p class='c007'>The three men leaped upon the bank,
and, at the command of Price, all discharged
their pieces after the retreating Indian, but
without effect. Pursuit was then ordered,
but Price, observing that Campbell did not
follow, turned and asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are <i>you</i> not coming, sir?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No!” was the prompt reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>Price felt for his revolver, but finding it
gone, he only muttered, “Curse you,” and
then commenced the pursuit. For over a
mile it was kept up. The pursuers gained
upon the Indian, who was considerably obstructed
in his flight by the weight of the
female. At last Price exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the eternal, there come the Yankees!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sure enough, just appearing in view upon
an elevated point a little beyond, was seen
a squadron of cavalry, and a section of flying
artillery rapidly advancing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To the hill! Give the signal for our
guns—to the bridge—secure the prisoner
in the boat!”</p>

<p class='c007'>These commands were given by Price, as
he commenced a rapid retreat toward the
bridge. Pausing on the hill just before
reaching it, he unfurled a small flag and
made a signal. In an instant all was astir
in the rebel camp, and artillery and cavalry
soon came dashing down the hill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is the prisoner?” yelled Price, as
he came to the bridge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps the young man you left here
has taken him to camp.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But the boat is gone! However, there
is no time to be lost, now. They are upon
us! Quick!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Price started for the opposite end
of the bridge, followed by his three confederates.
The rebel troops were still some
distance from that end of the bridge nearest
their camp, which it was evident they intended
reaching, if possible, in order to
sweep the narrow passage, if the Union
forces attempted to cross. The Federals,
however, were the first to gain that point.
But, had a crossing been effected, as soon as
they reached the opposite side they would
have been exposed to the most galling fire
of the enemy, as there was a large space of
flat, swampy ground in front; and then a
sharp bluff, upon which the rebel artillery
would, in such a case, be planted. The
commander of the Federals, observing this
situation at a glance, ordered a halt, and
brought his section of artillery into position.
One piece was placed so as to enfilade the
bridge, and the other upon a little rise of
ground, in a position where it could sweep
their lines beyond. The rebels observing
this, threw forward two guns, amid a deadly
fire from the Unionists, and succeeded in
taking a position upon the opposite end of
the bridge. Several rounds of grape were
hurled back and forth, but as the cover was
good, but little damage was done. The
cavalry attempted a crossing, but the thick
growth of oaks prevented. A charge was
about to be ordered across the bridge, when
an explosion took place, and it was shattered
to fragments. Taking advantage of
this, the rebels made a rapid flight. As
pursuit was useless, the command was given
to fall back to Springfield.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indian we have spoken of now approached
the commander, leading the trembling
woman, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me save—you save—white squaw!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you require my protection?” asked
the commander.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettie told her story in an artless manner,
of which the reader has gleaned all necessary
particulars. She was kindly provided
for, and soon reached Springfield in perfect
safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after the arrival, a soldier came to
the tent of the commanding officer, presenting
a bit of paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Colonel, I picked up this scrap near the
bridge, but did not look at it until this moment.
It may be of importance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The colonel took the paper and read
aloud:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>“A suspicion of my fidelity to the Confederate
cause has crossed the mind of my commanding
officer, Lieutenant-Colonel A. M.
Price, simply because I consented to assist
Miss Nettie Morton to reach Springfield,
from which point she might be able to rejoin
her friends, who formerly resided in Ozark,
but are now in St. Louis. I was condemned,
in consequence, to be the executioner of a
<i>wounded</i> Federal officer. At this cowardly
act my whole nature revolted. Chance has
favored me, and I have determined to save
him. In what manner I can not here write,
fearing this paper should fall into Confederate
hands, and my plans be thus interrupted. I
can not learn who he is. I asked his name,
and I have some reason to believe that Miss
Morton may throw some light upon the subject,
as the only words he spoke were ‘Net—murdered—sister—.’
He bore the rank of
captain.</span></p>

<div class='c008'><span class='sc'>Charles Campbell.</span>”</div>
<p class='c006'>The colonel turned toward Miss Morton,
who was seated in his tent, and asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you feel any <i>especial</i> interest in any
Union officer now with us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Morton hung her head and blushed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not fear to speak, and frankly, too,
Miss Morton. Perhaps the welfare of one
you love—perhaps his safety, may depend
upon your candid confession.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—I—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you ever <i>met</i> one of our officers?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But once. And then I only passed the
evening in his society. He was kind, but
he has forgotten me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is enough, you love him. But the
short time he was with you could scarcely
have made an impression so deep that he
would mutter your name in his delirium.
And yet, the wounded man was near your
residence. And he exclaimed ‘Net—’.
Your name is Nettie, is it not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what is the name of him you refer
to?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Captain <span class='sc'>Harry Hayward</span>!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The officer was visibly affected. “‘Nettie.’
‘Net—.’ ‘Nettleton!’ ‘<i>Murdered.</i>’ ‘Sister.’
It is very strange. Harry Hayward’s
body was not found, but he was assassinated.
Ah, I begin to fathom the mystery.” He
murmured all this in words not audible to
the astonished Miss Morton, and left the
tent slowly, as if oppressed with the weight
of a momentous thought.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><b>CHAPTER IV.</b><br /> <br /><i>Nettleton’s Adventure in a Noose—Some Important Information.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> surprise of Walker was very great
at the unexpected movement of Nettleton.
His sword flashed from its scabbard, and he
made a half-pass at his breast. But, checking
himself, he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“William, I can forgive you in consideration
of your grief, and I spare you, that
you may assist in the care of Miss Hayward.
Curse him!” he muttered to himself, “I
would strike the infernal dog dead at my
feet, but the act would only place a greater
barrier between me and my prize. Miss Hayward,”
he added aloud, “you will always
find me ready and most anxious to serve
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Hayward will not lack for friends,
sir!” replied Alibamo, in a tone of contempt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Captain Walker, I shall place the prisoner
in your charge. You will forward at
once.” These words were spoken by the
colonel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walker bit his lip, and was silent. He
then commanded the guard to forward, muttering
as he did so:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The second most agreeable job. I’ll
revenge myself upon him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As the guard formed around Lieutenant
Wells, he turned to Miss Hayward, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! dear lady, you have inadvertently
confessed that you had some regard for me.
This is not a time to speak of such things,
but I will now say to you, that which has
never before passed my lips, excepting to
your brother. I love you, with a devotion,
ardent as it is pure and holy; and by that
love I swear, and beg you to believe, that I
have never harmed your brother!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Hayward turned toward him, and
made a movement as if to reach his side,
but Walker held aloft the bloody knife, which
met her gaze, and, with a shudder, she turned
to Alibamo.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Forward!” cried Walker, and Edward
Wells, the once popular officer and general
favorite, was urged on, bound and guarded,
charged with, and generally believed guilty
of, the foulest of crimes. But yesterday he
was on the road to honor and fame; now
he was marching forward to a disgraceful
death. The entire division was soon in
motion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton now approached Miss Hayward,
and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Mamie, I am going to do all for
you such a darn sk— I mean such a chap
as me <i>can</i> do; but, I’m feard that ain’t much.
But you’re going now where there ain’t no
danger, and if you please, I’m a going to
stay behind and hunt for the captain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! thank you, William,” sobbed Miss
Hayward. “How can I ever repay you,
dear friend?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t—don’t!” said William. A choking
sensation came over him, and, unable to
say more, he turned away, only to be comforted
by Miss Sally Long, who placed her
hands upon his shoulders, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“William, if you will find the captain, I’ll
<i>love you dearly</i>!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton started back, opened his eyes
wide—so he did his mouth, as if attempting
to speak. His lower jaw wagged two or
three times, but no sound was heard. Then
turning his eyes, he saw the gaze of all fixed
upon him, and started off suddenly upon a
run, exclaiming as he did so:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who ever thought it possible that <i>I</i>
should ever be loved by Sally—such a darn
skunk—a sweet gal, I mean!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton did not pause until he had
overtaken the colonel, of whom he requested
permission to remain and make a more
thorough search for his captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, William,” was the reply. “We will
not be a mile distant before the enemy’s
scouts will be here, and you will be taken
prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No fear, they don’t notice such as me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But your uniform will be sufficient.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! I always go prepared. I have
another suit <i>under</i> this, one as I got from
the bushwhack I laid out the other night,
as he came noseing around Captain Hayward’s
tramping ground, and I shall put
that on top.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, do as you like, but be careful!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton waited for no other words, but
turning, proceeded at once to the spot where
Hayward received the fatal stab. He sat
down for a time, silent and mournful, gazing
into the water. He then commenced a
scrutinizing search. He became satisfied
that the body could not have floated down
the river, on account of the shallowness of
the water. He crossed the stream, searched
upon the opposite bank, and there found
the footprints of a number of men. He followed
the tracks, and found that <i>two</i> persons
had descended <i>into</i> the river, and out
again, near the same spot. He took the
measurement of each impression in the mud,
and then exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll be darned if Lieutenant Wells’ boot
made any of <i>them</i> marks! I know how it
is. Captain must have come here last night
to think, and some of them darn rebel
skunks come up behind him suddenly, and
killed him, and then two of them crossed
over and got his body, and brought it back,
and that accounts for the tracks in and out
of the water. But what did they want
with him if he was dead? Perhaps he
wasn’t quite killed, and they took him prisoner.
I’ll follow these tracks, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton followed up the footmarks until
they merged into the turnpike, which was
so cut up with travel as to prevent him
tracing them further. He now returned to
the fatal spot. Bending down he examined
the earth, still red with blood. Something
appeared to interest him, and creeping on
his knees, he followed a footprint to the edge
of the stream. Here was an impression of
<i>two</i> boots, side by side, in the mud. Nettleton
gazed upon them for a few moments.
His breast heaved violently—he clenched
his hands, and at last said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve blacked <i>them</i> boots. I know ’em
well—there is the impression of the <i>two
hearts</i> in the mud, and there ain’t but one
pair of boots in our camp as has <i>two hearts</i>
made with nails in the ball of each boot.
Oh, you darn—”</p>

<p class='c007'>Something caught the eye of Nettleton
in the water. He sprung in and secured
it. It proved to be a handkerchief, which
bore a name upon the corner. He gazed
upon it a moment, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The man as had on <i>them</i> boots stood
in <i>them</i> tracks, and washed himself in that
river. He wiped upon this hankercher and
then threw it into the water. Folks as
washes the evidence of murder off their
hands, don’t wash in the river, throw away
the wiper, and then take a tin pot of bloody
water to—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What the devil are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton turned to behold a party of six
horsemen who had suddenly approached
him. In his anxiety he had forgotten to
change his clothing—that is, to cover his
blue uniform with the rough gray suit he
wore underneath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So, you are a Yankee soldier,” exclaimed
one of the party.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No I ain’t; I’m a darn skunk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This reply, and the ungainly appearance
of Nettleton, caused a laugh throughout the
entire party.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are not a Yankee soldier? Then
what are you doing with that uniform?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton looked at his dress, and for the
first time became conscious that he had not
changed it. He, however, instantly replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am a spy for the General.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What General?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“General Price, to be sure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This created another fit of merriment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just as if the likes of you would be
employed as a spy! Why, you don’t know
enough to last you half a mile.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s just the reason why I <i>am</i> a spy.
I am such a darn skunk no one pays any
attention to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you been in the Yankee camp here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you a Confederate uniform under
that blue?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” replied Nettleton, throwing off
his coat and exposing the gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To what company and regiment do you
belong?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No company. I go it on my own hook.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know General Price?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, very well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you ever been in his camp?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Often.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Describe him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton had, on one occasion, accompanied
a party of disguised Union officers into
the very camp of Price, while that General
held possession of the upper Osage. One
of the officers being detected and wounded,
was borne along with the retreating rebel
army from the Osage to Springfield, and
Nettleton had followed on for the purpose
of rendering assistance if possible. His apparent
stupidity prevented suspicion, and he
had been one of the leading spirits in a rescue
which afterward occurred. He was, in
consequence, not only known to General
Price himself, but to a large number of his
officers and men, and hence it was very desirable
for him to avoid the main army.
He supposed that he could deceive his captors,
or effect his escape. And the shadowy
thought that Captain Hayward might have
been seized and borne toward the rebel
quarters at once decided his course. He
gave an accurate description of Price.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good!” answered one of the party, “it
is evident you <i>are</i> a spy. I find you on the
spot the Yankees have just left. You have
<i>their</i> uniform on and <i>ours</i> under it. So far
that <i>looks</i> well. You know and have perfectly
described our General. That renders
it certain you have seen him. Now, one of
two things is certain: you are a <i>Yankee</i> spy,
and have been in our camps with that gray
uniform <i>outside</i>, and then communicated
your information to <i>your</i> General, or you
are a <i>Confederate</i> spy, who, having just been
in the Yankee camp, must have important
information for <i>our</i> General. In either case
we shall conduct you to him. If you are
his man, then all will be right. If you are
<i>not</i>, then you will be hung within half an
hour after your arrival. You understand?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I first thought of going on to Springfield,
but I think I have all the information
necessary, and I had made up my mind to
return. I halted here a moment to change
my dress; and to look for a Yankee officer
who was supposed to be killed last night.
But I think he was only badly wounded,
and may yet be found alive in the tall grass.
Look for him.” These words were spoken
by Nettleton in an apparently cheerful tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! you mean the captain who was
stabbed last night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes; do you know any thing of
him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You appear especially anxious, Mr.
What’s-your-name?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am anxious,” replied Nettleton, fiercely.
“He insulted me, and I would be revenged.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t trouble yourself. He’ll catch it
soon enough. He was <i>not</i> killed, but was
taken out of the water by us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who struck the blow?” yelled Nettleton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No one of our party. We were concealed
upon the opposite bank. We could
not see the murderer strike, for it was too
dark; but we saw the body thrown in the
stream, and saw the stabber wash himself
in the river. We would have fired upon
him, but were afraid of rousing the Yanks.
We waited until he left the body, after
throwing it into the stream, and then we
recovered it. The man was still alive. He
had only fainted from loss of blood. We
dressed his wound as well as we could, and
then conveyed him to a house the other side
of the pike. He will recover; but Colonel
Price has an especial spite against him. He
met him once at Springfield. So, <i>when</i> he
recovers he will be hung.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is he now?” asked Nettleton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At a little house not fifty rods from
here, just the other side of the pike.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Without a word, Nettleton bounded like
a deer in the direction the Federal forces
had taken. But a dozen shots were fired
after him, and he fell. He was soon secured,
when it was ascertained that one
bullet had cut the neck badly, and another
had struck the ankle, although it had not
broken the bone. He was still able to
walk, and, after being bound, he was dragged
forward toward Cassville.</p>

<p class='c007'>A march of forty miles was almost too
much even for the tough Nettleton, more
especially as he had received a severe shot
in the ankle; but he bore up firmly, and
at last arrived at the outskirts of the rebel
camp. He had become very lame, and
rolled about like a ship in a heavy sea.
As he entered the camp, many were the
jeers and taunts which hailed this specimen
of the Yankee soldier. Nettleton made no
reply, although his countenance bespoke his
contempt.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was now near the quarters of Price.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By thunder!” yelled one of the Confederate
soldiers, “that is the very fellow who
fooled us at Springfield. Hang him! Hang
him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>An explanation was soon made, and Nettleton’s
fate appeared certain, as a “drumhead”
court-martial had already been convened.
Sentence was soon given—the
Yankee spy was to be hung upon the spot!</p>

<p class='c007'>A rough scaffolding was formed, under a
large tree, and a rope, with the fatal noose
attached, thrown over a limb. Nettleton
ascended the platform in silence, although
his frame trembled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never saw a Yankee yet that did not
fear to die,” exclaimed one of the bystanders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you see one now, you darn skunk,”
replied Nettleton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why do you tremble, then?” asked the
Confederate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was thinking of the captain, and of
his poor sister ‘Mamie.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha! ha! ha! This booby is in love.
A romantic spy. And the idol of his passion
is called ‘Mamie!’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You lie, you dog!” yelled Nettleton.
“I only—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is all this?” asked a stately-looking
officer, who had just approached, and
before whom all the rest fell back.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A spy, General,” was the response.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why was he not brought to <i>my</i> quarters?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because Raines ordered a drumhead
court-martial.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Release the man until I have conversed
with him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton was released, and, as he descended
from the scaffolding, he was recognized
by General Price.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have met before?” asked Price.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, General, we have,” was the prompt
reply of Nettleton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What were you doing in my camp the
<i>first</i> time we met?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Serving my captain, whom I love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good! What are you doing here now?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That will require considerable explanation,”
added Nettleton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go on,” said Price.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, General, some darn skunk <i>murdered</i>
my captain, and when our troops left
Grand Prairie, on their return to Springfield,
I remained behind to search for his body.
I am <i>no</i> spy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you said you were a spy, serving
General Price,” replied one of the soldiers
who had brought Nettleton to the rebel camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How can you explain this?” asked
Price.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, ye see, General, Miss Sally—no,
I mean Miss Mamie—that’s the captain’s
sister—will break her poor heart and die
of grief if she can’t learn something about
her brother. Them darn skunks as arrested
me told me that Captain Hayward was <i>not</i>
killed. Besides this, as nice a darn sk— I
mean as good a man as ever lived, and one
who loves Miss Sally—no—that Miss Sally
keeps running in my head—one as loves
Miss Mamie, is accused of murdering the
captain. But I know better, for I found
proof enough to convict the right one. I
wanted to tell Mamie that Sally—darn Sally—that
her brother was <i>not</i> dead, and to
clear Lieutenant Wells and convict the one
as did the deed. So I told them sneaks as
how I <i>was</i> a spy, in hopes they’d let me
alone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Would you give any information you
may have gleaned here, if I should set you
free?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I ain’t no such darn skunk, General.
Honor is honor bright with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What have you seen here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A lot of the darndest sapheads I ever
met.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I should set you free, will you fight
against me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Like the devil, the first time we meet
in fair play.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why do you wear that gray suit under
your uniform?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because captain’s always getting himself
into some scrape, and I have to hunt him
up. Sometimes I have to go among the
Johnnies to do it, and then the blue ain’t
healthy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you ever act as spy upon me if I
let you go?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not unless capt’n does. But I’m his
body-guard, and shall go everywhere he
does, if I can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is your name?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“William Nettleton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, William, I think we shall be
obliged to hang you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, General,” answered Nettleton,
stepping upon the scaffolding again. “And
them darn sneaks shan’t say they never
see’d a Yankee die bravely. But, General,
let me ask of you one favor. You don’t
want to see a good fellow shot for what he
didn’t do, and a murderer go clear, do you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then all I ask is, that you send this
handkerchief to Colonel Mann, and tell him
the murderer didn’t wash in a basin in his
tent, but in the river, and then threw this
wiper away; and that the guilty one has
<i>two hearts</i>, made with nails, on the sole of
each boot. And tell Sally—no, Mamie—that
the captain is—Lieutenant Wells—and
Walker—the skunk, when I’m dead—that
Sally—no, capt’n, won’t think of poor Nettleton—and—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh stop! stop! William, I can never
recollect all this. You had better go yourself
and attend to this matter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What, General? Do you mean it?”
cried William, as he sprung from the scaffold
and gazed earnestly at Price.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On one condition I will permit you to
go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That as soon as you have given your
evidence in the court-martial which will
probably be ordered, you will return at
once <i>and be hung</i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll do it; I’m a loafer if I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You swear it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, by the great jumping jingo, and
Sally Long’s tearful eyes!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The guard will see this man safely beyond
our lines,” said Price, speaking to one
of his officers, “and furnish him a pass and
a horse. Let one of our men accompany
him near to the Federal lines, and bring
back the animal which William will ride.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton rushed forward, and grasping
the hand of Price, shook it violently, and
then exclaimed, as he took his leave:</p>

<p class='c007'>“General Price, you ain’t such a darn
sneak as I thought you was!”</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><b>CHAPTER V.</b><br /> <br /><i>The Court-martial and the Hostage.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> division which had been encamped
on Grand Prairie reached Springfield in
safety, and formed their temporary camp in
the field, back of the brick school-house,
which stands about a quarter of a mile to
the west of the new court-house.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first order issued to the officers of
the battalion of Benton Cadets, the Thirty-fifth
and Thirty-seventh Illinois, was to
assemble at a given time, to act upon a
court-martial, at the quarters of Major D—,
Judge-Advocate, to try the case of Lieutenant
Edward Wells, charged with willful
murder of Harry Hayward, a captain in the
service of the United States of America, and
attached to the army of the Mississippi, now
under command of Major-General Hunter.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a sad day! Lieutenant Wells was
a favorite with both officers and men of his
command. He always had been mild as a
female, kind and benevolent—sacrificing his
own comfort for the good of the privates in
his battalion. True, some said that Wells
would not fight bravely—that he ought to
have been created a <i>woman</i>; but everybody
gave him credit for being the kindest of the
kind. When first accused, there arose a
very bitter feeling against him. Captain
Hayward also was a great favorite with the
men. He was a stern but kind soldier.
When the news of his brutal murder came
to the knowledge of his “boys,” their first
cry was “revenge,” and they naturally sought
some one on whom to wreak their vengeance.
At first Lieutenant Wells narrowly
escaped a summary fate, more especially as
it was whispered about camp that Wells had
become a suitor for the hand of the fair
Mamie Hayward, had been <i>rejected</i> by her,
and spurned by the captain. But in a short
time it was given out that Mamie had confessed
her affection for Wells, and that Captain
Hayward had remarked in the presence
of others, that he deemed Wells an honorable
man, and would gladly favor his suit.
This turned the tide of feeling in favor of
the lieutenant, and when the court-martial
was convened, nothing but a consciousness
of a soldier’s duty prevented an open revolt,
or at least a most decided and forcible expression
of feeling. But, trusting to the
judgment of the officers forming the court,
the soldiers decided to await the result.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have our readers ever witnessed a trial
by court-martial? It is not like the ordinary
court of justice. First, the charge is
read, as thus:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lieutenant Edward Wells, of Company
H, Battalion of B—— C——, is charged
with the willful murder of Harry Hayward,
a captain in the U. S. army.</p>

<p class='c007'>“2d.—Specification.—1st. In this, that
said Lieutenant Edward Wells, did, on the
night of the seventh day of November, 1861,
assassinate and murder said,” etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Following this, in any case of the kind,
would be found a list of “specifications,”
setting forth in detail, all the chief events
connected with the crime.</p>

<p class='c007'>The prisoner was brought to the tent of
Major D—— to answer to the charge. He
was very pale, yet perfectly composed; and
when the question was asked, the ready and
firm response was:</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Not Guilty!</span>”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Judge-Advocate, a noble-hearted but
just man, informed the prisoner that he was
to act, not only as “prosecuting counsel,”
but as “counsel” for the prisoner, and that
he (the Judge-Advocate) must give the prisoner
the benefit of any doubt that might
arise in his favor.</p>

<p class='c007'>To those of our readers not familiar with
the <i>modus operandi</i> of a court-martial, we
would give the following information for
their benefit:</p>

<p class='c007'>The doors of the court are closed to all
outsiders. The prisoner makes his plea, and
retires. The witnesses are brought forward
and examined, but no cross-examination is
allowed. If a question is to be asked by
any of the officers sitting upon the court, it
must be reduced to writing, and silently
handed to the Judge-Advocate. If he sees
fit to put the question, it is done; if not, it
is thrown aside.</p>

<p class='c007'>We will now proceed to a brief summary
of the trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lieutenant Edward Wells, you are
charged with the willful murder of Harry
Hayward, a captain in the United States
service. What is your plea. Guilty, or <i>not</i>
guilty!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not guilty!” was the decided response.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let the first witness be called, George
Swasey, colored.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The person familiarly known as “Swasey’s
nigger” took the stand. When brought forward,
he glanced around as if fearful of
something, and then asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is Massa William Nettletum where he
can hear dis chile tell de truff?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have nothing to fear from <i>any</i> person,
if you <i>do</i> speak the truth, and <i>all</i> the
truth,” replied Major D.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well den, de fact am dis. I went to
see my gal. When I cum back, I met de
rebs. I hid behind a log. I see’d some
one stick a knife in massa cap’n, and I
heard him say:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Oh! Nettletum, you kill me!’”</p>

<p class='c007'>All questions were answered in the same
spirit, and it became evident that the negro
believed Nettleton the real murderer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next witness brought upon the stand
was Alibamo Hinton. She swore that Nettleton’s
tent was next to the one she occupied—that
he was in attendance upon her
and Miss Hayward, by permission of Captain
Hayward, and that Nettleton had <i>not</i>
been out of her presence that night. In the
first part of the evening, Nettleton had remained
near her door; in the latter part, he
had missed his captain, and had prostrated
himself on a rug near the tent entrance.
She had seen him there <i>all night</i>, as she had
not slept at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Hayward was too much overcome
to appear as a witness, and was excused.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next witness was Captain Hugh
Walker.</p>

<p class='c007'>The feeling of the soldiers, to learn the
result of the trial, was intense, and by the
time Captain Walker was called to the stand,
some twenty or thirty had crept to the edge
of the tent, and endeavored to conceal themselves
in the tall grass outside, to catch the
proceedings. But they were discovered by
Walker, who demanded that they should be
removed. This was done, and a guard
placed outside.</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Walker’s oath was as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the night of the seventh of November,
I followed Captain Hayward from his
tent. It was at the time gradually becoming
dark. My motive in doing so I will
explain. As soon as it began to be rumored
that we were to meet Price, I observed a
change in the conduct of Captain Hayward.
He had ever been the center of attraction.
His tent was the ‘head-quarters’ of ‘our
circle,’ drawn thither by the natural gayety
of the captain, and the presence there of
ladies. But this feeling appeared to forsake
him, and on more than one occasion he
denounced the war as inhuman. Pardon
me; I would not speak against the dead,
but I doubted the loyalty of the man, and
<i>not</i> his courage, and this it was which
induced me to follow him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I halted beneath a large tree, which
stood near the spot where the murder evidently
was committed. I saw the captain
seat himself upon the bank. At this time
it was quite dark, but I saw a shadow approaching.
It passed near me, but I failed
to discover who it was. I first thought it
might be William Nettleton following his
master. I listened attentively, however, as
the extreme caution of the intruder attracted
my attention. In an instant I heard a
groan, a heavy fall, and a voice exclaim:
‘Oh, William, where are you? Nettleton,
I am murdered. <span class='sc'>Wells</span> <i>is the assassin</i>!’”</p>

<p class='c007'>A shudder ran through the court. Major
D—— dropped his head upon his hand and
was silent. The officers whispered together.
At last, a written question was handed to
the Judge-Advocate, which was promptly
asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Captain Walker, why did you not give
the alarm, or arrest the murderer yourself?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir,” was the prompt reply, “the sequel
will show. It was dark; I could not distinguish
the features of any person two
yards distant. I feared he might escape if
he should discover me. I therefore followed
the murderer cautiously, and he entered the
tent of Lieutenant Wells. He did not
strike a light, but I listened, and heard him
washing himself. I kept close watch upon
him until morning, to make sure I was not
accusing an innocent man. No one entered
or left the tent. The one who washed his
hands, and left the bloody water, was Lieutenant
Edward Wells.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This evidence was conclusive. But no
reason could be assigned for the murder,
unless it was that Miss Hayward had been
heard to say that she never should marry
and leave her brother so long as he lived,
and it had now become well known that
Wells was a suitor for her hand. Still, he
was a favorite with the captain, and even
on the day of his death Hayward had been
heard to say that he believed Wells a man
of honor, whose suit he would favor. The
only conclusion which could be arrived at
was, that Wells believed the love of a sister
was too strong to give immediate place to
the love of a wife, and he felt that, the brother
once removed, he alone would become
the object of Miss Hayward’s affection. This,
though but a flimsy pretext for so awful a
crime, was all that any one could offer in
the way of a surmise.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trial was over. But one decision
could be given. It soon was rumored about
camp that sentence had been passed, and
that at four o’clock the next day it would
be read to the prisoner, in presence of the
whole division.</p>

<p class='c007'>The night was wearing on. A form,
closely enveloped, approached the tent of
the commanding General. It proved to be
the lady Alibamo.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is the will of our ‘daughter of
the army?’” asked the General, kindly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is that I may visit Lieutenant Wells,
and bring him to my tent. I desire that
an interview should take place between
Miss Hayward and the doomed man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The General seated himself at his table,
and penned a few words, which he handed
to Mrs. Hinton. She glanced at the contents,
and then falling at the feet of that
officer, she seized his hand, and kissing it,
sobbingly exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What! <i>without</i> his chains? God bless
you! God bless—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There, there! Go! go! Don’t make
<i>me</i> weep, or I won’t forgive you,” returned
the veteran warrior, as he turned away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alibamo left his tent, and in a few minutes
entered her own, in company with
Lieutenant Wells, now free from all apparent
restraint.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Wells entered the tent, Miss Hayward
was kneeling by the side of her camp
cot, her face buried in the folds of its coverings.
For several moments not a word
was spoken, and, as Wells gazed upon the
stricken sister, he trembled violently, while
a groan of intense anguish escaped him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alibamo advanced, and gently touching
her companion, said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamie, my darling, here is <i>our friend</i>,
Lieutenant Wells.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Hayward did not raise her head, but
reached forth her hand toward Wells, which,
quickly kneeling by her side, he took, and
pressed to his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, heaven bless you!” he moaned.
“<i>You</i> do not believe me capable of the
dreadful crime with which I am charged?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Hayward tried to speak, but convulsive
sobs choked her utterance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, my ever kind and dear friend,” replied
Alibamo, “she does <i>not</i> believe you
guilty. Nor am I satisfied that Captain
Hayward has been killed. I am under the
impression that he was wounded and taken
prisoner by some rebels, who were lurking
near our camp.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You <i>hope</i> for the best, and so do I; but
have you any grounds for the formation of
such an opinion?” asked Wells.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and to me the best of evidence.
William Nettleton went in search of the
captain. If he was killed, William would
have found his body before this, and returned
to us with the intelligence. His continued
absence convinces me that the captain
is still alive, and that his faithful friend Nettleton
is at this moment following him. It
is this hope which gives me fresh courage,
and I believe a few days will see you free,
and your name as untarnished as it should
be. I wished to tell you this, and I also
wished Miss Hayward to express to you
personally, her confidence in your innocence;
hence, I brought you here. You may leave
us now, as my poor friend is too much agitated
to converse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wells was about to depart in silence, but
Miss Hayward for the first time raised her
face, and her tearful eyes met his own. He
sprung forward, and kneeling before her,
pressed his lips to her white forehead, and
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“That look is worth to me years of happiness.
But, you can read my heart <i>now</i>.
When I am <i>proved</i> innocent, then I will
speak the words which must not, till then,
pass my lips. God bless you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He arose to depart, but was met by Captain
Walker, who had just entered the tent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walker cast a rapid glance around him,
and placing his finger upon his lips, enjoined
silence upon all. Wells stood, with arms
folded, sternly and suspiciously gazing upon
him, while Alibamo asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are your wishes, sir?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To serve you and your friend,” was the
reply, spoken in a low voice, and with apparent
hesitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It must be an important service which
could render pardonable the fact, sir, of
you having, unannounced, and so rudely,
intruded upon our privacy,” said Mrs. Hinton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It <i>is</i> an important service. No less than
the rescue of——will you be seated?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The parties seated themselves in silence,
when Walker continued:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must pardon me if I speak plainly,
and directly to the point. It is necessary
that I should be brief.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Proceed, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Hayward,” continued Walker, turning
toward the lady, “I must give a few
words of explanation to you. I <i>did</i> love—<i>do</i>
love you now. You need not shrink from me.
You will, upon hearing my words, understand
me better. No man loves without
hope, until there arises between him and
the one beloved some impassable barrier.
The barrier which arose to blast <i>my</i> hopes
was, your previous love, and the unfortunate
circumstance which has made me an
unwilling witness against one to whom, as
I think, your heart still clings.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will please be brief in comment,
and come as quickly as possible to the point
in question,” replied Mrs. Hinton, as she observed
the agitation of Miss Hayward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I come to the point now. I know Miss
Hayward is very unhappy, and I would not
add to it. I would save her lover.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To whom do you refer?” asked Wells,
coldly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To you, sir,” was the prompt reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can not claim the title you honor me
with, in connection with that lady. Besides,
she might not thank <i>you</i> for such a service.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes! yes!” eagerly replied Miss
Hayward, as she gazed upon the speaker.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stay one moment, Miss Hayward,” answered
Wells. “Let us first learn in what
manner my deliverance can be effected.
Captain Walker, you can proceed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You speak very coldly, Lieutenant Wells,
to one who comes to offer you service. But,
before I proceed, I must exact a promise,
that if my proposition is not accepted, those
to whom my words are addressed will make
no exposure of the same.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a nod of assent, and Walker
proceeded:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will not deny the fact that solicitude
for Miss Hayward impels the act. But of
this no more. Lieutenant Wells, you are
unbound and unwatched. Place your sash
across your breast, as worn by the officer
of the day. I will give you the counter-sign,
and thus you will be enabled to pass
the pickets, and make good your escape.
You can secure a safe retreat, and, after the
excitement of the mur—of this unfortunate
affair—has died away, Miss Hayward can
be apprised of your place of concealment,
and take such action in the case as her
judgment or heart may dictate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A deathlike silence reigned for a moment,
during which rapid glances were exchanged
between the friends. At length Wells
asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Captain Walker, would not an escape
imply, upon my part, an acknowledgment
of the crime of which I am accused?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It might, in the estimation of many.
But, you are generally believed guilty. What
matters it what your actions imply to <i>them</i>?
Your friends here, who have already made
up their minds, will merely look upon it as
a desire upon your part to escape a certain,
an unmerited, and a dishonorable death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you will assist my flight?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And will you afterward convey Miss
Hayward to me if she will come?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With pleasure; you but anticipate my
intended services.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Another rapid and significant glance
passed between Mrs. Hinton and Wells,
which was not observed by Walker.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One thing more, Walker: do <i>you</i> believe
me guilty of murder?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“H’m—I <i>did</i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And <i>now</i>?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I <i>may</i> have been mistaken. But, be
that as it may, I will assist your flight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you ready?” asked Wells, rising.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish you to return to your cell, and
when all is ready, say <i>two or three o’clock</i>,
I will come for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I will not go!” was the firm reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walker perceived his mistake, and quickly
added:</p>

<p class='c007'>“As you please, sir.” And turning, he
was about to leave the tent, when he was
confronted by the “officer of the day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Captain Walker,” he said, sternly, “you
feel an especial interest in Lieutenant Wells.
I did not suppose so, but learned the fact
from your conversation. I am glad you <i>do</i>
feel so great a friendship for him. You
shall have opportunity to make it manifest.
You shall become his Pythias!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you mean, sir?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This: that the sentence of Lieutenant
Wells will be read to-morrow afternoon at
four o’clock. In the mean time, you, as
his dear friend, do not wish to see him confined,
and will most cheerfully take his
place in the prison, and wear his chains.
If the lieutenant is <i>present</i> to-morrow at
four, you, as his hostage, will be released.
If he should escape, as you have advised,
of course you will be held as an aider and
abettor in that escape; and when you receive
that punishment your guilt deserves,
you will have the consolation of knowing
that you suffer for the benefit of your very
dear friend! Soldiers,” commanded the officer,
“place the irons upon Captain Walker,
and convey him to the guard-room in the
old log-building.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you mad? You <i>dare</i> not do it!”
yelled Walker, as he foamed with rage.
But the soldiers promptly obeyed the command,
and Walker was taken from the tent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This indignity shall be avenged!” but he
was carried quickly forward, and the guard-room
door soon closed upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will be at liberty, upon your parole
of honor, until to-morrow at four o’clock,
Lieutenant Wells.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The officers shook hands and separated.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><b>CHAPTER VI.</b><br /> <br /><i>The Gunpowder Plot and the Conspirator.</i><br /><i>The Mystery Unfolding.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Just</span> as the fading twilight was yielding
to darkness, and before Lieutenant Wells
had been removed from his cell by request
of Alibamo, a scene occurred to which we
must revert.</p>

<p class='c007'>The room in which Wells was placed was
in the wing of a log-house, just in the rear
of the brick school-house to which we have
alluded. Two doors led from this apartment,
one opening into the garden, the other
into the main building. This latter door
had been firmly secured. Near that opening
into the garden, was a small window,
the only one in the apartment. As the
guard was stationed at the door, escape
from the room was impossible. Surrounding
this garden were a number of hedges
running in various directions, some of them
forming the street fence, while others ornamented
the winding gravel walks.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as it was quite dark, a person
closely enveloped and disguised, emerged
from among the tents, and passed cautiously
along in the still intenser darkness of the
hedge shadow. Ever and anon he would
pause and listen. Finally he reached the
further hedge, remote from the camp. He
paused a moment, and then gave a low and
peculiar whistle. It was immediately answered,
and two men joined the first
comer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you ready?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No!” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And why not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because we have not received our pay.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is that the <i>only</i> reason?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The only reason after you have given
us full instructions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is your powder?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the upper part of the garden, under
the hedge. We have secured eight twelve
pound shells which we took from that battery
over yonder. Powder enough to blow
a mountain to the devil.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, here is a hundred apiece. When
the job is done, you will find as much more
in the hollow log that I pointed out last
night. Be careful and make sure work!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, your instructions!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will follow the outer hedge. Creep
along with great caution, and make no noise.
There will be no danger, as the guard are
not on the north side of the camp. When
you reach the log-building in the rear of
the brick school-house, you will observe a
small wing, or addition, extending to the
rear. At the back of this wing you will
find an excavation under the house sufficiently
large for your shells. Place them
in it, lay your train, and then apply the
torch. But you must do this with great
caution, as a guard is stationed upon the
opposite side.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t be alarmed. Any one near that
old log-shanty will go to kingdom come before
to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The trio then separated.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c007'>When Captain Walker was seized and
chained by the soldiers, he made a desperate
resistance, but in vain. He soon occupied
the little room vacated by Lieutenant
Wells. The door closed; he heard the
clanking of the heavy chains which secured
it, and left him in utter darkness. He
stamped, and raved and cursed. Suddenly
starting, and wildly clutching his throat, as
if some terrible thought had crossed his
mind, he groaned and sunk upon the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fool! oh! fool that I was! I thought
if I <i>pretended</i> friendship, and offered to assist
in his escape, all suspicion of this night’s
work would be diverted from me. But now—oh!
my God! What is the hour? Hark!
I hear them working under the building!
No! it is not the men yet. It is too early.
I dare not tell the guard, for an acknowledgment
of any suspicion of such a plot
would be a confession of <i>my</i> guilt. Let me
search for some mode of escape!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Walker crawled cautiously around the
floor, but not a crevice could be found.
Finally, exhausted, he sunk down, giving
way to his utter despair. An hour—two
hours—dragged slowly by, which appeared
an age of misery to the wretched man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I give the alarm, even saying that a
peculiar sound attracted my attention, the
ruffians who are to do the work, will recognize
me, and I shall, thus implicated, suffer
an ignominious death! What is that?
Great God! they are at work! But they
are making so much noise that the guard
will hear them, and I shall yet be saved!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t make quite so much noise in
there, if you please!” exclaimed the guard,
as he knocked upon the door where he was
stationed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not me!” yelled the frantic man.
“Some one is at the rear of the building, trying
to dig through—they want to kill me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will see about that!” replied the
guard, as he left his post, and walked toward
the spot indicated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walker fell upon his knees and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! I am saved—saved that dreadful
death!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He bent down, and applying his ear to a
small crevice between the logs, where the
mud-mortar had fallen out, he listened. He
could distinctly hear the words spoken.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you silenced that d—d guard?”
was asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, cut his wizzen. No danger. Hurry
with the train of powder!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gentlemen!” yelled Walker, “don’t go
any further. I am not the man!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quick—fire the train!” exclaimed a
voice outside.</p>

<p class='c007'>A flash was seen, and then another said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Curse it, the train has failed. Throw
the torch among the shells, and then run!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Walker waited to hear no more, but
throwing himself with all his violence against
the door, he set up a series of yells, which
made the camp ring. In a moment steps
were heard, the door was thrown open, and
Walker, livid with fear, and frantic, staggered
into the open air, gasping for breath.
When he had sufficiently recovered his
fright to listen, the commander of the squad
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The powder-plot has been discovered,
sir. There is no further danger on that
head. But you will return to your cell!”</p>

<p class='c007'>This order Walker was compelled to obey,
and he was again left in darkness, with
feelings better imagined than described.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c007'>The night wore slowly away. Lieutenant
Wells had retired to his own tent. His
calmness of demeanor certainly did not indicate
a guilty mind. Alibamo, too, was
wakeful, and strove by every possible kindness
to sustain the heart and hopes of her
suffering companion. Miss Nettie Morton,
who had so recently joined their society,
was occupying a tent in company with Miss
Sally Long, near that of Mrs. Hinton. They
also, were watchful—anxious for the morrow.
But, perhaps, the most wretched
person in that camp was Captain Hugh
Walker. No officer would have dared to
place irons upon him and confine him in a
rough cell, upon any slight pretext. Was
it not possible that something of a serious
character had been discovered against him?
This surmise seemed to haunt him, for he
acted in a manner to indicate the wildest
apprehensions of danger.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning came at last, and slowly the day
advanced. A guard brought Walker his
breakfast, but the man refused to answer
any question. During the afternoon he
heard the beating of the drums, and the
bugle-blast, which he well understood was
calling the division together for some important
purpose. He felt satisfied that one
object was the reading of the finding of the
court-martial in the case of Lieutenant Wells.
But, what part was <i>he</i> to play in the scene?
This was the question which caused his
heart to beat with violence, as the chains
fell from the door of his prison, and he was
called forth.</p>

<p class='c007'>He accompanied the guard in silence,
and soon entered the hollow square formed
by the three brigades of the division. Walker
glanced eagerly around, and there, standing
beside the commanding General, was
Lieutenant Wells, with Miss Hayward leaning
upon his arm, and near them were their
female friends. But a few paces distant
were the two ruffians who had been engaged
in the powder-plot. All was silent.
The General advanced and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Preliminary to other proceedings, I wish
to ask Captain Walker if he ever before saw
these two men?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The ruffians advanced, rattling their chains.
But Walker drew back, and with forced
calmness he replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never have!” He dropped his head,
gazing upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>The adjutant who held the sealed orders
of the court-martial by which Lieutenant
Wells had been tried, then advanced, and
was about to commence reading the document
in his hand, when a series of yells
were heard, and in the distance was seen the
grotesque form of Nettleton, as he came
bounding along and bellowing:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop the shootin’! Stop the shootin’!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was well known throughout the army
that Nettleton had remained behind in search
of Captain Hayward. As he approached,
the most intense excitement was manifest.
Lieutenant Wells could scarcely control his
feelings, and would have rushed forward to
meet Nettleton, had not Mrs. Hinton gently
laid her hand upon his arm, begging him to
be calm. Miss Hayward clung closer to her
lover, as she hoped the news about to be
brought by her brother’s friend would relieve
her agony of suspense. A half-suppressed
cheer broke from the soldiers, as
Nettleton burst into the square.</p>

<p class='c007'>He paused for a moment, his breast heaving,
and his eyes glaring wildly. But an
instant was sufficient for him to discover
that Wells was yet alive, and that the object
of his suspicion also lived. He sprung
forward, and, without uttering a word,
seized Walker by the foot, which he at once
drew under his arm; then he as suddenly
bounded for the spot where the commandant
was standing, dragging the foot along
with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course this sudden movement on the
part of Nettleton had thrown Walker violently
upon his head, and, although he
kicked, and squirmed and cursed, he was
dragged along as if he had been a child.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Nettleton reached the commander,
he held the foot of Walker within a few
inches of that officer’s face, and yelled:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look! look! General—see them boots!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding the intense anxiety felt
for the result of Nettleton’s search, the ridiculous
figure he presented in his eagerness,
and that of Walker who was twisting and
struggling to escape, a general laugh ran
through the division, which was joined in
by the commander. Even Wells could not
suppress a smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what about those boots?” asked
the commander, after silence had been restored.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, I’ve blacked them!” yelled Nettleton.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another laugh was heard along the line.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No doubt you have blacked them. But
what of this?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, General, don’t you see them <i>two
hearts</i> made with nails, on the sole of that
boot?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly I see them. And what then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Walker was now permitted to resume his
upright position, and he stood trembling
with fear and rage, as Nettleton went on to
relate his first suspicions of Walker, his
search for the body of Captain Hayward, his
finding the impression of the footprints
standing side by side in the mud, at the edge
of the stream, with the marks of <i>two hearts</i>
in the sole of each boot; and then the finding
of the handkerchief in the water, which
Nettleton then produced.</p>

<p class='c007'>The officer took the white linen witness,
examining it closely, and then said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here is the name of ‘Walker,’ in the
corner. William, did you find this <i>near</i> the
place where the murder was committed?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Right by the spot where them two
boots stood!” replied Nettleton, pointing to
Walker’s feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can explain this,” exclaimed Walker.
“I went to the river that day to wash, and
I stood upon the bank to do so. I presume
I left the impression of my boots there at
that time. If I did not, was I not also
present in the morning to examine the spot
where the murder had been committed?
And is it a wonder that the impression of
my boots should be left behind?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is certainly true,” replied the General.
“But of the handkerchief?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It fell from my hands as I was washing,
and I did not take the trouble to recover
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is very probable!” replied the General.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So you perceive,” replied Walker, as he
appeared to gain courage, “your trumped
up evidence has fallen to the ground! I did
not expect a combination of both officers
and men against me, but I find it so. And
they wish to see <i>me</i> suffer for the bloody
deed done by that coward. The only reason
I can assign for this persecution is, that
he is in favor with the <i>ladies</i>, and you, sycophants
that you are, hope, through him, to
gain favor with his fair companions. No
doubt some bargain to that effect already
has been effected!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Walker had by this time become
eloquent, and defiant. Nettleton, with his
too eager perceptions, had failed to foresee
the possible fallacy of his proofs, for hope
and prejudice together had prevented any
calm examination of his evidence. With a
sorrowful and troubled look, he turned away.
This gave Walker greater confidence, and,
in a loud but hoarse voice he cried:</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now I demand justice!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Which you shall have,” replied the General.
“But first answer me; how did this
handkerchief, which bears your name, and
which you confess to having used in the
stream, become <i>bloody</i>?”</p>

<p class='c007'>That was another point of interest, and
Nettleton paused to listen attentively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had a bleeding at the nose, and the
reason I threw the dirty thing away, was, I
did not think it worth washing!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then some person must have recovered
it, washed it very carefully, and thrown it
into the stream again, for <i>there is</i> <span class='fss'>NO</span> <i>blood
upon it</i>!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Walker attempted a reply, but his utterance
failed. The General enjoined silence,
and then stepping forward he said, in a
voice sufficiently loud to be heard by all
present:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Captain Walker, I must sum up, before
you, the evidence of crimes you have committed,
which have no parallel in the history
of the army, or of crimes which have ever
been, or attempted to be committed in any
civilized country. I would give you the
benefit of a court-martial, were there any
doubt of your guilt, and even <i>now</i> may <i>order</i>
a trial, but it will only be a formal one.
You had better confess your guilt, here, before
all—ask their pardon—make reparation
to those you have most injured, and die
repentant!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have nothing to confess!” responded
Walker, bitterly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you no fear of the revelations of
these two soldiers?” asked the General,
pointing to the chained ruffians.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have no fear! No doubt they have
been bribed to conspire with you! But, vent
your spite! Go on!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, Captain Walker, I will briefly
enumerate the circumstances which have
been developed, as well as the <i>facts</i>. The
morning we left Grand Prairie you were in
command of the squad which escorted the
prisoner, Lieutenant Edward Wells. You
had not proceeded far when you were overtaken
by two men. It was a very easy
matter to secure an audience with you as
you were in the rear of the division. They
suggested that you should deliver Lieutenant
Wells to them, as their commander had an
especial spite against him, and wished to secure
his person. You asked these men (I
refer to the two ruffians now in chains and
standing by your side,) how they dared to
approach you on such a subject, and they
replied that they had <i>witnessed your act</i> the
evening previous, and that you need not
put on airs with them! You then requested
these fellows to meet you the next evening
at the upper hedge. You instructed them
to secure a number of pounds of powder for
some purpose, which you would then explain.
You met them the next evening.
You gave them instructions. They were
about to act upon them, when your outcries
from the cell in which <i>you</i> had been placed,
and which Lieutenant Wells had left only a
short time previously, attracted the attention
of the guard, and you were rescued. Prior
to this you had offered to assist Lieutenant
Wells to escape, but you wished him to return
to his cell and remain until two or
three o’clock. The fiendish act was to be
committed between twelve and one. You
<i>pretended</i> friendship, that all suspicion of the
act might be diverted from you. Have I
spoken correctly, sir?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No doubt you have spoken according
to the story of those ruffians!” replied
Walker. “You can not bring against me
any <i>respectable</i> proof. I look to a court for
the justice which I have no reason to expect
here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Walker, who had been shaking like a
guilty wretch during the speech of the
commander, turned in the direction indicated.
The rough garb had fallen from the ruffians;
their chains were thrown aside, and, to his
astonishment and horror, there stood two of
the regimental Union officers, <span class='sc'>Adjutant
Hinton</span>, the husband of Alibamo, and his
friend, <span class='sc'>Captain Clark</span>!</p>

<p class='c007'>Walker, who now saw how he had been
entrapped, and detected in his infamy, for
a moment was utterly unmanned. But, his
resolute nature soon triumphed over his
fear. Well realizing that penitence could
not save him, he sprung to his feet and
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is all a miserable, contemptible conspiracy—an
effort to make out a case against
me to shield that woman’s pet from the
consequences of his clearly proven crime.
Hayward is dead, and can not be made to
answer, else—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You lie, you dirty, nasty, murderin’
skunk!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What!” exclaimed a dozen voices.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He lies! the coward that stabs a man
in the dark! Hayward is not dead, but
lives, and will soon by his evidence send
this murderer to kingdom come!”</p>

<p class='c007'>With a shriek Miss Hayward bounded
forward, and fell at the feet of Nettleton,
grasping his hands. Wells, who had borne
bravely up until this moment, covered his
face, and wept tears of joy and of relief
from the imputation of crime. Sally Long
sprung to the side of Nettleton, and, throwing
her arms around his neck she gave him
a hearty kiss, which caused him to roll up
his green eyes, and appear in almost as
much agony as if he had been struck in the
stomach with a cannon-ball. The word
was soon passed, and the soldiers, catching
the fire, made the very welkin ring with
their shouts, while the band chimed in with
the stirring strain: “Hail to the Chief!”</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><b>CHAPTER VII.</b><br /> <br /><i>A Live Hero—The Retrograde Army Movement.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>The</span> villain Walker was returned to his
lonely cell. Lieutenant Wells was released
from all restraint. The soldiers dispersed
to talk about the strange turn events had
taken, but the center of attraction was Nettleton.
He was seated in front of the Hinton
tent. Close beside him was Miss Hayward,
kneeling, and gazing mournfully into
his face, while Alibamo, Wells, the General,
Nettie Morton, Sally Long, the officers who
had composed the court-martial, the especial
friends of the parties, and as many of the
soldiers as could get within hearing distance,
were earnestly listening to the narrative of
the “body-guard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton went on to relate his meeting
the rebel scouts, and the fact of their having
informed him that Hayward had only been
wounded and conveyed toward Wilson’s
Creek, by a party attached to the command
of Lieutenant-Colonel Price.</p>

<p class='c007'>[The reader will mark the distinction
between Lieutenant-Colonel Price, who was
a ruffian guerrilla, and had broken his parole
three times—an act repudiated by all honest
soldiers of either army—and General Sterling
Price, who, although a rebel, always had
acted in a gentlemanly and humane manner
to all prisoners of war.]</p>

<p class='c007'>After listening to the story of William,
the General drew from his pocket the note
which had been found at the Ozark bridge,
signed “Charles Campbell.” This note
must have been written but a few moments
before the fight took place. The date would
be just two days after Hayward had received
the assassin’s stroke, giving about the
proper time for the wounded man to be
carried from Grand Prairie to Ozark, at
which latter place Lieutenant-Colonel Price
had formed a temporary camp. The writer
spoke of a wounded man in a boat, and
against whom Price had an especial spite.
This confirmed the conviction that Hayward
had been taken thither for the especial gratification
of Price’s fiendish propensities.
The note also said that he bore the marks
of a captain’s rank, and, in his delirium,
spoke of “Net—” which might have referred
to the young lady, Nettie Morton, whom
he possibly might have seen in the distance,
upon the bank, as the boat neared the spot
where she was standing, or, as seemed more
probable, that the wounded captain was
calling upon Nettleton. At all events, it
was decided that the person of whom Charles
Campbell had written, was no other than
Captain Hayward. It is true, he was still
almost insensible from his wounds, and was
near the camp of his most unforgiving enemy,
but, there was a friend at hand—an
enemy in arms—but a friend to the wounded
and helpless soldier, as are all true men—and
he had written that “he <i>would</i> save
him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why should we not hope?” asked Alibamo,
as she clasped her friend Mamie in
her arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And why should we not <i>act</i>?” cried
Wells, as he clutched the hilt of his sword.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, we <i>will</i> act,” yelled Nettleton, as he
sprung up, and appeared ready for instant
departure.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go, William; follow the stream from
Ozark, until you find some trace, and then
return to us,” said Miss Hayward, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton turned his gaze upon Miss Sally,
for a moment, and then, as if ashamed of
his hesitation, or of his weakness, in exhibiting
<i>any</i> symptoms of love, he started with
a bound, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m off. Good-by, all!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had proceeded, however, but a few
steps when he halted, and, scratching his
head, his countenance assumed a most woful
expression, and his eyes rolled wildly about.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is the matter, William?” asked
Wells.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Got to go t’other way!</i>” was the melancholy
reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why so?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, just a bit of—fun—that’s all!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, tell us what it is, Nettleton?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t! It will break <i>her</i> heart!” he
replied, pointing to Sally.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So it would, William, if any thing dreadful
should happen to you!” replied Miss
Long, as she dropped her eyes to the
ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There, didn’t I tell you so?” replied the
faithful servant, his mouth gaping and his
eyes expanding.</p>

<p class='c007'>“William,” asked Wells, “do you really
<i>love</i> Miss Long?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Love her, lieutenant? That ain’t no
name for it. Why, can’t you see yourself
that she’s the sweetest darn sk— no, I mean
the nicest critter in the world—exceptin’
Miss Mamie!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And does she love you, William?” asked
Alibamo, smiling in spite of herself at the
tableau enacting before her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Of course I do!</i>” replied Sally, proudly
and triumphantly, as if a victory had been
won.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There—there! Do you hear that? Now,
don’t you pity me? I believe I am the most
ugly cuss in the world. I never thought
anybody would ever love <i>me</i>, and now I
find out the gal as I wants most is just the
one as does love me! Oh Lordy, I’m sick,
I do believe!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right!” Wells responded, with a
smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right! Not by a blasted sight, sir!
Did <i>you</i> think it all right when you loved
Miss Mamie, and thought you had to swing?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What! You talk in riddles. Explain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>I’ve got to be hung!</i>” he roared, but,
whether with pain or delight, none could
tell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, <i>you</i> didn’t have any thing to do
with hurting the captain?” cried Sally, as
she advanced toward her beloved.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton gazed at her an instant with a
most singular expression, and then replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Long, never let suspicion cross
that delicate bo— mind of yours, but like
the true turtle-dove, put your trust in the
uprighteousness of your future lord and
master, what is to be hanged all on account
of the first time you wrapped them delicate
arms of yourn around my long neck.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“William, what do you mean by being
hanged?” asked the General.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton then went on to relate the
agreement he had made with Price, to return,
and undergo the punishment which
was about to be inflicted upon him when
that General interfered. He declared his
intention of returning at once, as his “furlough”
had run out, and as a “man of honor”
he must return.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And do you really intend to return?”
asked the General.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Of course I do!</i>” replied William, with
something of scorn and much of pride in his
tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“William, think for a moment. You are
now safe. You are with one who loves you,
and with whom you can be happy. Why
will you return?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“General, don’t argue this point with me.
I said I would come back, and darn me if
I don’t!” Nettleton started, after having
shook the hand of his friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stay a moment, Nettleton,” said the
General. “I have a letter from General
Price with regard to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton paused and listened, as the
commander, opening the envelope, read:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c010'>
    <div><span class='small'>“Camp near Cassville, Nov. 12th, 1861.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='small'>“<i>To General ——, greeting</i>:</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>“A prisoner of war was released from our
camp, and permitted to return to Springfield,
on the 9th. It was at first thought that he
was a spy, as he had been seen in and near
our camp before, and he was about to suffer
death upon the scaffold, when I saw and
questioned him. I became convinced that
he was no spy, but a faithful servant and
friend, searching for his captain, whom he
loved. I ordered his release. I gave him a
parole of honor. He promised to return that
the sentence of the ‘drum-head court’ could
be carried into effect upon him, after he had
given the evidence he possessed, which he
declared was necessary to save an innocent
man. I admire his truthfulness. Should
he be determined to return, of which I
have no doubt, you will read this letter,
which releases William Nettleton from any
further obligation. He will remain with his
friends, and be happy.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='small'>“Signed by the A. A. A. G.</span></p>

<div class='c008'>“For the Commander, <span class='sc'>Price</span>.”</div>
<p class='c012'>The effect upon the gallant fellow of the
reading of this letter, was somewhat singular.
He stood for a moment gaping around
upon the spectators, as if he had been caught
in some mean act. Then a smile came
over his face like sunlight creeping over a
rugged mountain top. Soon his countenance
looked like a newly risen sun—fairly
blazing with blushes. Then, with a wild
<i>whoop</i>, which rung out like a signal, he
sprung into air, rattled his feet together, and
once on earth again, bounded off like a great
moose, for the nearest thicket, where to indulge
his “feelings” without restraint.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crowd dispersed in good-humor, to
talk over the strange events of an hour. If
one heart was happier than all, it was that
of poor Mamie, whose joy at the proven innocence
of her friend and lover was too
intense for words. In her heart a new hope
had also arisen, that her dear brother would
again be restored to her arms, and thus fill
up the cup of her blessings to the brim.</p>

<p class='c007'>It had been decided by the friends of
Hayward, that a search for the captain
would be useless, but it was hoped that
Charles Campbell would give some information
which would lead to his discovery, or
that Fall-leaf, a celebrated Indian scout, who
had now been absent many days on the very
line of the enemy’s march, would return
with some tidings, by which the actions of
the captain’s anxious friends should be governed.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c007'>The Army of the Mississippi, having
passed from Fremont’s command to that of
General Hunter, had been ordered to fall
back from Springfield, in two columns.
The one by the way of the Osage and Warsaw
to Tipton, Mo., on the line of the main
Pacific road, and the other by way of Lebanon,
on the main road between Springfield
and Rolla, the south-western branch of the
same road. Each place, in distance from
Springfield, was about one hundred and
twenty-five miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The march of the division to which Captain
Hayward’s friends were attached, which
was under the command of the brave Sigel,
was commenced on the morning of November
20th. That division formed the rear of
the entire army. It proceeded by the Rolla
turnpike.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing of note transpired until the division
was ascending the rolling hill about
two miles before reaching Lebanon, when a
horseman, his face and head streaming with
blood, rode rapidly along the lines, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fight in front! Fight in front!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He halted for no one to question him, but
kept on his way. No guns were heard, and
many expressed the opinion that it must be
a strange fight. But, as a necessary precaution,
the infantry-men were halted, their
pieces loaded, and bayonets fixed. The
artillery was charged, and flags unfurled.
As the troops ascended the hill, and looked
in vain for a foe, the question was asked:
“Where is the fight?”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was soon settled, as another messenger
rode up and informed the General that a
party or squadron of rebel cavalry, numbering
about four hundred, had attacked a little
band of “home guards,” of about thirty,
which had been collected in a valley some
twenty miles south of Lebanon, on the main
road, in a place called “Bohannan Mills
valley.” Most of the thirty “home guard”
had been killed, wounded or dispersed by
the guerrillas. Then all families in that
vicinity known to entertain Union proclivities,
were visited at the dead of night.
“Murder and arson” was the cry. Many
poor creatures soon were in the agonies of
death. Husbands, who had rushed from
concealment to defend their wives, had been
cloven to the earth; children ran shrieking
to and fro, only to be dashed to pieces by
the savages of the Missouri Mountain. It
was a carnival of lust and blood, over which
the historian ever must dwell in horror.
And yet, these fiends in human shape were
protected by the ægis of the “Confederate”
flag!</p>

<p class='c007'>Such was the scene depicted by the messenger,
when the division was halted, and a
consultation took place. It was decided
that, while the main army went forward,
two companies of infantry, a section of
artillery, and a company of cavalry, should
be detached to proceed at once to “Bohannan
Mills,” to protect the helpless families,
and, if possible, to punish the rebel horde
which had committed such awful crimes
against humanity.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><b>CHAPTER VIII.</b> <br /> <br /><i>Gone!—The Signal Song.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>We</span> must now take the reader back to
Springfield. It was one week after the exposure
and confinement of Walker, and
something like a month before the army
had commenced its retrograde movement,
as described in the foregoing chapter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walker, after the first paroxysm of his
rage was over, settled himself down to think.
Although he had shown a bold front at first,
his final conviction drove from his heart all
resolution, and he evinced the most abject
cowardice—the cowardice of conscious guilt,
which makes the strongest tremble.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Walker was not a man to sit quietly
in his cell, and submit to his fate. His mind
having been settled in the conviction that
certain death would follow, he began to form
his plans of action. To arrive at any definite
conclusion was no easy matter, as he
was chained, and a double guard placed
around his quarters. Yet he had hope—time
was given and all might yet be right.
He learned that he was not to be tried by
a division court-martial, but would be removed
to St. Louis, in order that a general
court might act upon his case. He also
learned that it would be at least a month,
before the army would take up its march.
Thus he had time—time precious to him—for,
like all shrewd villains, he had his confederates,
even in the army as well as out of
it, and to these he now looked for his bodily
safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the third night of his incarceration,
that, springing to his feet, he listened
intently. There were three distinct taps on
the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The rescuers—the gang—I’m saved!”
he muttered, as he gave three taps on the
door, in response.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the word?” was asked from the
outside.</p>

<p class='c007'>“C. S. A. and the Bars!” answered Walker.
“And you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good! Union against oppression!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To-night?” asked Walker, with eagerness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, the pal on the other side ain’t for
Union. Can’t before day after to-morrow.
Jim goes on then, and though it ain’t my
turn, I think I can get pony No. 2 drunk,
and the job can be done. I’ll try.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be cautious. Trust no one without the
word. It was the neglect on my part, thinking
it all right, to demand the ‘words,’
which brought me into this scrape!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The “rounds” approached, and the sentinel
was relieved.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing of importance transpired in
camp for the next three days. An unusual
quiet prevailed. It is true, there was much
talk upon the subject of the attempted murder,
and many expressions of bitterness
against Walker. Some even went so far as
to suggest the hanging of that wretch before
the army left Springfield, lest he should escape.
None were more vehement than a
repulsive looking soldier, known throughout
camp as “ugly Jim!” He stated that he
had been on guard only a few nights before
in front of the prisoner’s quarters, and that
he had every reason to believe Walker was
trying to escape, adding that he wished he
had been satisfied of the fact, as he would
have been glad of an opportunity to put a
bullet through the murderous scoundrel.</p>

<p class='c007'>The party had been drinking freely, and
had become exceedingly communicative.
One of the soldiers, whose post was No. 1
on guard duty that night—that is, in front
of the prisoner’s door—swore he would shoot
Walker if he could find any pretext.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>You</i> have no spite against him,” exclaimed
ugly Jim, “and <i>I</i> have. Let <i>me</i>
take the matter in hand. I will stand your
guard, and if the villain attempts to move,
I’ll riddle him, sure as Potosi lead mines.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Enough said. I am on the second relief.
I go on at seven and off at nine;
again at twelve and off at two. This will
be your time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good! I shall be on hand!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ugly Jim then approached the tent of
Miss Hayward, and requested an audience
alone with that lady. It so happened that
she was alone, Alibamo having gone to visit
her husband, and Sally being at the time
strolling through the camp with Nettleton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you wish to learn all the particulars
about your brother, I think you can do so,”
said Jim, in a tone of great kindness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! in what manner?” asked Miss
Hayward, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t exactly know. But I will tell
you what I <i>do</i> know. You see I am on
guard to-night from twelve till two, over the
cell of Walker. I don’t like the villain any
way, but, he told me if I would get you to
come to him, he would tell you all he knows
of the matter!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly I will go. Call Alibamo, and
we will go together, at once!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will,” answered Jim, as he turned to
depart. Then pausing, he added:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Hayward, now I recollect that
Walker said you must come alone. He declared
he would not commit himself by
speaking before any one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I dare not go alone!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor child!” exclaimed Jim, as he
wiped his eyes. “Do you think you <i>can</i>
be alone when this old soldier, as folks call
‘ugly Jim,’ is near you? I know my face
is ugly, but I don’t think my heart is! Besides,
you won’t <i>see</i> the wretch himself. You
will only talk to him through a crack between
the logs, and I shall be as close to
you as Walker will allow. Of course he
wont let <i>me</i> hear what he says, but I shan’t
let you be out of my sight, so there will be
no danger!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why can we not go at once?” asked
Miss Hayward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I don’t go on post until twelve
o’clock, and the other guard wouldn’t let
you speak to him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I will come at quarter past twelve.
But I shall rely upon you for protection!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may do that, miss. And I really
think you do right. I know Walker is a
<i>very</i> bad man, but he has got to die, and
may be he wants to make a confession to
relieve his mind, and to ask your pardon.
And I always think it best to give a dying
man a chance to relieve his mind, and confess.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may expect me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Jim bowed, and left the tent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Twelve o’clock came; the guard was relieved,
and “ugly Jim” had taken the place
of his <i>sick friend</i>, in front of Walker’s prison.
All was quiet, save the clanking of a
chain, a few hurried whispers, and the opening
and closing of a heavy door, which
sounds were in close proximity to Walker’s
dungeon. The words “<i>C. S. A. and Bars</i>”
were answered by “<i>Union against Oppression</i>,”
and two dark forms glided to concealment
beside the thorn hedge, while the
guard remained at the door.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c007'>The evening dragged slowly along for
Miss Hayward. A hundred times she had
almost resolved to communicate to her
friends the fact of her intended visit to
Walker, and to ask their advice, and, if
need be, to request that some one should
follow in the distance, to lend assistance,
should any be required. But what had she
to fear? Walker was secure in his cell, and
one of the faithful guard had promised his
protection. Besides, she had promised to go
alone. If she did not, it would imply suspicion
of an honest soldier. Walker might
also ask if she had come entirely unattended,
and how could she answer him?</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Hayward was naturally timid, and
by no means self-reliant. When the news
of the supposed death of her brother reached
her, she was almost paralyzed with grief.
But, now that hope had filled her heart, she
began to nerve herself to the task of unremitting
search, even though she must encounter
the greatest dangers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hour of twelve arrived. Closely
muffled in a cloak, she crept from her tent,
and then paused to listen. She heard nothing,
save the slow and regular breathing of
the sleepers, and the violent beating of her
own heart. She started, but her steps seemed
to fail her, and she leaned against a tree for
support. The thought of her dear brother,
and the probable unraveling of the mystery
which surrounded his attempted assassination,
and his present fate, gave her renewed
courage, and she sped onward. In a few
moments she had cleared the camp, and
arrived in the center of the garden, where
stood the doomed man’s prison. As she
neared the door, the guard asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is that you, Miss Hayward?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is!” came the low response.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Approach and fear nothing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She had barely reached the threshold,
when two forms, darting from beneath the
hedge, threw a heavy blanket over her head,
thus entirely smothering any attempt, on her
part, to give the alarm. Who and what her
captors were, she could not divine, or what
might be their purpose. Strange to say, her
reason did not forsake her. She felt herself
borne rapidly along, but not a word
was spoken. It appeared to her that hours
passed by, and she even longed to hear some
word uttered which might give a clue to the
intentions of those in whose power she was,
or to throw some light upon the subject, as
to whom her captors were. The blanket,
which was very heavy, almost causing suffocation,
had been removed, and a lighter
one substituted.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length the parties halted, and, seating
themselves upon the ground, the covering
was removed, and Miss Hayward was permitted
to gaze around her. Her eyes first
met those of Captain Walker. She shuddered,
and turned away. Then glancing at
his two companions, she at once recognized
“ugly Jim,” and a person known in camp
as “stupid Dick,” both of whom had served
as Union soldiers, for a long time, under
Walker. As her eyes met those of “ugly
Jim,” she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! <i>you</i> will protect me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>A laugh was the only reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I trust Miss Hayward will permit <i>me</i> to
become her protector!” said Walker, in an
assumed tone of kindness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Hayward did not reply, but gazed
around her. She was in a wild spot. She
was seated beside a lovely stream of water,
in a deep valley, while high on either hand
were ragged hills or mountains. She knew
the country for at least ten or twelve miles
from Springfield in all directions was quite
level, and she judged she must be near the
Ozark country, the first range of whose
ridges she had frequently seen from that
point.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does not the lovely Miss Hayward deign
a reply to her most devoted lover?” asked
Walker.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What was your purpose in tearing me
from my friends, and conveying me here?”
asked Miss Hayward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A pardonable one, I think. My life
was forfeited in the Federal camp, and personal
interest required me to depart. I
could not think of leaving without you, and
so I resorted to a little stratagem. My love
for you must plead my excuse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I have told you, Captain Walker,
that I could not love you. Do you suppose
after what has transpired that I could entertain
any other feeling toward you than
detestation?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am aware of that. But, when you
know me better, I am sure you will consent
to reward my devotion. I am going to
convey you to your brother!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I <i>will</i> thank you, at least!” exclaimed
Miss Hayward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing else?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She shuddered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must be plain with you,” continued
Walker. “I am <i>not</i> what I have seemed
to be while with the Federals. I am a colonel
in the Confederate army, but I accepted
a commission in the so-called Union army,
that I might furnish information to my Generals.
Or, if you like the term better, you
may call me a spy. These two soldiers
have been with me for the same purpose.
And we were not alone. There are now,
in the army of the Mississippi, over three
hundred privates, and over twenty officers,
who <i>pretend</i> loyalty to the Federal cause;
and I think, when his sister has become the
wife of Captain Walker, or Colonel Brown,
he may be induced to join us!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you take me to my brother?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“On one condition, I will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And this condition?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Hayward, I love you with all the
ardor of my soul. You have become necessary
to my very existence—<i>are</i> a part of
my life. When you spurned me, it drove
me frantic, and I am so now. Beware—oh!
beware how you turn this heart, which is
yet pure, so far as you are concerned, into
a hell of furies! Pity me! Oh! dear Miss
Hayward, pity me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But my brother—what of him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will tell you of your brother when
you have answered my questions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Proceed, sir!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not speak so coldly. I will be frank
with you. Your brother is a prisoner—not
in the Confederate camp, but in a secure
place, on the very stream beside which you
are now sitting. The murmuring and singing
of these very waters will, ere two hours,
greet his ears with the same strain. Warble
those strains to which I have so often
listened while in camp, and which stirred
my soul, and they will be borne direct to
your brother’s hearing, to relieve his brain
perhaps from the insanity which now enchains
him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Insanity!” echoed Mamie. “My brother
insane?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is a raving maniac! And but one
thing can restore him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh wretched, horrible news! What
<i>can</i> I do to save my brother?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are the only person who <i>can</i> save
him. Nor is the task a hard one. Only a
few miles from here is a Confederate camp.
A chaplain is in attendance. He will perform
the ceremony which will make you
irrevocably and securely mine. Go with
me. Become my wife, and to-morrow I
will take you to your brother, and we will
not only restore his shackled feet to liberty,
but his shattered senses to reason. We
alone can do it. Can you assume the responsibility
of a refusal?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Hayward remained silent for a few
moments, and then gazed alternately at the
three villains. An unnatural fire lit up her
eyes. At length she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Captain Walker, I do not know but you
are even now deceiving me. You may not
know any thing about where my brother is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ask these soldiers,” replied Walker.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Hayward turned her eyes upon
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The captain speaks right,” answered
Jim. “He <i>does</i> know where your brother
is. He <i>is</i> crazy and is chained in the—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Silence!” commanded Walker. “Do
you believe, Miss Mamie?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must believe the worst,” answered
Miss Hayward. “Soldiers,” she added,
turning to the soldiers, “do you believe in
the truth of Captain Walker’s profession of
love for me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should like to know why not!” replied
Jim, doggedly. “Nobody could <i>help</i>
loving you; even I loves you, but I know it
ain’t no use, and so I don’t say nothing!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What have <i>you</i> to say?” asked Mamie,
turning to the other soldier.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lord, Miss Mamie, I allers loved you,
but ‘stupid Dick’ never thinks of such as
you, and so I acted mean just to spite!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gentlemen,” cried Miss Hayward, springing
to her feet, “listen to me. You have
wronged me deeply, by aiding this wretched
villain, your captain, to abduct me. I despise,
loathe him; and, sooner than become
<i>his</i> wife, I would permit my brother to die
as he is, for I know that he would curse me
were I to save him at such a sacrifice. It
will be <i>but</i> death, and I shall suffer very little,
for my brother’s pure soul will scarce
have taken its flight, ere mine will follow!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Hayward!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Silence, Captain Walker. Soldiers, you
have human hearts, and this man has not.
I appeal to you. Save me! Find my
brother and return him safely, and I promise
to pay you one thousand dollars each.
If I fail to do this, I swear, by the hope of
heaven, that I will become the wife of one
of you, the choice to be decided by lots between
you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>These words acted like an electric shock
upon the soldiers. They sprung to their
feet and confronted Walker. But he had
anticipated the effects of her words, and
stood sword and revolver in hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You would play me false!” demanded
Walker, fiercely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Guess I would!” replied Jim.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take that, then!” yelled Walker.</p>

<p class='c007'>The report of a pistol echoed through the
valley, and Jim fell without so much as a
groan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And how do <i>you</i> decide?” asked Walker,
turning and pointing his revolver toward
Dick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was only goin’ to help you. I ain’t
no such foolish cuss as to think of marrying
a fine lady like that! I’m all right!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Prove yourself so, and you shall <i>have</i>
your thousand. Deceive me, and you share
his fate!”</p>

<p class='c007'>As Walker spoke he stepped to a clump
of thick bushes, and drew a small boat from
concealment. Handing Miss Hayward to a
seat, and preceded by Dick, Walker entered,
and the little craft swept gently along with
the current, down the stream.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had proceeded but a short distance,
when Miss Hayward burst forth, and sung
a wild, thrilling air, which echoed far and
wide, through the valley and across the
hills. There was something strangely beautiful
in her song, and something still more
strange in her actions. As each strain
echoed over the hills, and gave back the
ringing notes, she would start, and listen attentively,
and a gleam of joy would lighten
up her pale face, upon which a shade of
disappointment would almost as soon appear.
Her hearers sat in silence, and in apparent
wonder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Those words are significant!” exclaimed
Walker. “What is their import?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>She’s</i> going mad, too, I opine!” exclaimed
Dick. “Better <i>let</i> her go!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Silence!” cried Walker. “Miss Hayward,
do you think your voice will penetrate
<i>his</i> retreat?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She made no answer, but, as the little
boat swept onward, ever and anon the same
words, and the same wild music broke the
stillness of the forest, now sounding like a
wail of sorrow, and then becoming almost
hushed in hopeful expectation. The words
had the appearance of being extemporized
for the occasion, and were as follows:</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><b>CHAPTER IX.</b> <br /> <br /><i>The Pursuit—The Perilous Situation—Important Information.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>It</span> was two o’clock in the morning, nearly
two hours after Miss Hayward had been
seized, and borne from the camp by Walker
and his confederates. The guard relief had
commenced his rounds. The first post visited
was that in front of the door where
Walker had been confined. A glance revealed
the prisoner’s escape. The chain
which had secured the door was lying upon
the steps, and the door itself was slightly
ajar. Walker and both the sentinels had
disappeared. The “long roll” was at once
beaten, and the camp aroused. Scarce had
the lines been formed when it was announced
that Miss Hayward also had disappeared.
The grief of her friends, and the rage of
the soldiers knew no bounds, and many was
the oath of a terrible retribution uttered
against the fiend who had spread such desolation
and sorrow in her path.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was but a few moments before squads
of cavalry were dashing in every direction
in pursuit. There was but little doubt as
to how the escape had been effected. The
disappearance of the guard convinced all
that they were in league with Walker, but
in what manner they had gained possession
of Miss Hayward was a mystery. No one
had detected any thing unusual in her manner
the evening before, and she had retired
at her usual hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was thought, however, that the parties
would not have taken any main road, as
the pickets would have given the alarm.
They could not have had more than two
hours the start, as every thing was all right
when the twelve o’clock relief went on
post, and at two o’clock the escape was discovered.
If Walker had to walk through
the fields in order to avoid the pickets, it
would take at least two hours to clear them.
It was most likely that, once outside the
lines, friends and horses would be procured.
Still, the distance would not be so great but
that our horsemen hoped to overtake them,
and so they set off with a good will in various
directions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are <i>you</i> not going to accompany us?”
asked Lieutenant Wells, of Nettleton, who
was seated upon the ground, looking gloomy
and sullen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not by a darn sight!” answered Nettleton,
doggedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And why not?” asked Wells.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You go ’long, and let me alone!” he answered,
sharply.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no time for words, and the
squadron departed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The night passed, during which Nettleton
was bitter in his self-reproach for not
watching closer, and would not hold conversation
with any person. As the first
dawn of day became visible, Nettleton was
seen crawling upon his hands and knees, in
front of the former prison of Walker, and
through the garden, toward the west. His
movements were watched with considerable
interest, as all had begun to respect him for
his sagacity, in his peculiar way. At length
he returned to his tent, and, without speaking,
carefully examined his double-barrel
shot gun—a beautiful piece which he had
picked up upon the Wilson creek battle-ground,
and had been permitted to retain.
This he loaded; then, taking a large artillery
ammunition-bag, he went directly to
the tent of Adjutant Hinton. Removing
the lid of a minnié-ball ammunition-box,
he filled this pouch with cartridges. His
next move was to place some provision in
his haversack; then he started.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where are you going, William?” asked
Mrs. Hinton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Them <i>boots</i>!” he replied, pointing in
the direction he had just taken in his hands-and-knees
examination.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, <i>them boots as had two hearts on the
soles</i> went <i>that</i> way, and I’m going to follow
if I go to thunder!” He waited to hear
no more, or to speak more, but bounded off
to the westward.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had been gone perhaps an hour, when
Fall-leaf, the Indian scout already referred
to, entered the camp. He was soon made
aware of the state of things. Fall-leaf was
deeply attached to Captain Hayward, and,
more especially so to his fair sister, Mamie.
The scout had been but a short time in
camp, when he had given to the General
all the information he possessed with regard
to the enemy. This done, he followed on
the trail fast as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>For several hours Nettleton kept on his
course, now striking the main road for the
purpose of searching for fresh tracks, then
taking to the woods again, to avoid observation.
Several times he came upon the
well-known footprints, and a bitter exclamation
would escape him. He kept his course,
more from the judgment he had formed as
to the direction Walker had taken, than from
the numerous impressions of his boots. He
was ascending a sharp and ragged hill,
so heavily covered with the thorn-bush and
small scrub-oak peculiar to that country,
that his progress was rendered very difficult.
Suddenly a figure darted in front of him
and concealed itself among the thick undergrowth.
Nettleton brought his gun to the
shoulder, and called out:</p>

<p class='c007'>“None of that skulking, darn ye! Come
out and fight fair!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ugh!” responded the voice, and Fall-leaf
bounded to his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! it’s you, is it, Mr. Ingen? Well, I’m
darn glad you’ve come, for you can hunt these
snarly woods better than me! Any news?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You kill ’em—eh?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall kill ’em, if I only get a bead on
the critter!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You <i>did</i> kill ’em?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Kill who?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dead soldier—there!” Fall-leaf indicated
that he meant further on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on, Ingen,” said Nettleton. He
reached the summit of the hill which overlooked
the valley below, and, led by Fall-leaf,
began its descent. They soon reached
the stream, and the Indian pointed to the
dead body. Nettleton gazed upon it a moment,
and then said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Darn me if it ain’t the very feller what
run away last night. Walker has been here,
sure!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He commenced his search at once. He
found footprints in the sand, and among
them that of a lady, judging from its small
size. The Indian had also been taking observations.
Returning from a clump of
bushes, he said to Nettleton:</p>

<p class='c007'>“See—canoe—two—White Bird—so!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here Fall-leaf indicated by action, that
two men had drawn a boat from concealment
in the thicket, had entered it, as indicated
by tracks in the sand, and had proceeded
down-stream.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, they’ve got rid of one scoundrel,
any way. It will only be man to man, and
I feel myself to be a match for any dozen
such skunks as that Walker. They can’t
have much the start!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Both Fall-leaf and Nettleton walked rapidly
forward along the bank of the stream.
At length—and it was almost a simultaneous
movement on the part of each—they
stopped, and bending forward, held their
ears close to the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By thunder!” cried Nettleton, “that’s
<i>her</i> voice!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“White Bird caged—<i>she</i> no sing!” replied
Fall-leaf.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ain’t you a darn fool? Don’t you know
that White Bird, as you call her, has got a
right to expect some of her friends will be
after her, and so she sings that they may
hear her voice, echoing up and down
among these hills, and know where to find
her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ugh! good—white hunter no fool!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again the voice was heard, and this time
so clearly as to leave no doubt upon the
mind of our hero, as to who the singer was.
Like a deer he bounded off in the direction
indicated. The music died away and all
was still. But the two men paused not.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon a sudden they emerged into an open
field of about four acres, near the center of
which were two large stacks of hay. The
river at this point took a bend, and the two
pursuers struck directly across the open
space. Just as they reached the stacks,
Fall-leaf darted close in to the base of one
of them, taking the attitude of a listener,
and making a significant sign to Nettleton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it?” asked Nettleton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hark! Soldiers! Horses! Whoa! Hark!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton listened attentively, and then
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is a party of soldiers coming. It
<i>may</i> be our men who have been in search
of Miss—— of the White Bird; but, it is well
enough to keep close. It may be the rebels
merely moving camp. And if this is so,
Mamie must be with them. The sounds
are coming nearer—crawl under the hay,
red-skin—way under, out of sight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was effected with some difficulty,
when a party of rebel guerrillas, numbering
about sixty, rode into the field, and proceeded
to form their camp directly in the
vicinity of the hay-stacks, under which the
two men were concealed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I guess we’ve got into the right
shop!” said Nettleton to Fall-leaf. “We are
cooped up here close enough for a while,
but, Miss Mamie must be with this crowd,
and when dark comes, we can scout around
and see what we can do. Lay quiet, Ingen!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“White hunter knows! Make good Ingen!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The day dragged slowly away. Toward
night a party of the rebels came for forage
for their horses, but the hay was tumbled
from the top of the stack, and our friends
were not discovered. The guerrillas’ conversation,
however, was listened to with the
greatest interest by Nettleton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So Colonel Brown, or Walker, as he is
called, came within one of being done for
in the camp of the Yanks at Springfield?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, so he says.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What the devil does he want with the
gal?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, some love affair, of course.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The gal was happy, for she was singing
like a nightingale.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh yes! No doubt she was dazzled by
the prospect of being a colonel’s wife.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is she?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My eyes! but she <i>is</i> a beauty!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So much the better for him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where was he going with her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, below—taking her to her brother,
I believe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Down in the <i>old mill</i>!”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was all the conversation heard by
the adventurers. But, the rebel troops did
not move again until late in the next day,
and our friends were compelled to remain
quiet. They had learned sufficient to convince
them that Miss Hayward was <i>not</i> with
this band of rebels, but was being borne
still further from them. They cursed the
chance which had thus entrapped them, and
prevented their overtaking the captive at
once. Still, they resolved to keep up the
pursuit, and they had learned that at <i>some
mill</i> the lady was to be conveyed, and that
her brother was there. Patiently they
waited until they could emerge, and finish
their journey.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><b>CHAPTER X.</b><br /> <br /><i>Hayward.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>It</span> is time the reader was enlightened,
somewhat, as to the fate of Captain Hayward.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wound he had received the night of
the attempted assassination, was severe, but
by no means fatal. The loss of blood had
rendered him very weak, and for some time
he remained insensible.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the moment the blow was inflicted,
there was, upon the other bank of the river,
and watching the Federals, a squad of rebel
cavalry scouts. The water into which Hayward
was thrown soon revived the wounded
man. He was seen by this band, and carried
to the house of an officer of the Confederate
army, not half a mile from the
spot. Here his wound was dressed. It was
not long before an order reached them,
signed by “Colonel Brown,” to convey him
to the camp of Colonel Price, at Ozark.
This order was law, and immediately after
the Federals left Grand Prairie, a boat was
procured, and Hayward placed in it. But
half conscious, he reached the Ozark bridge
at the critical juncture already described in
the chapter referring to the interview between
Nettie Morton and Charles Campbell, and
the interruption by Colonel Price, the rescue
of Nettie by Fall-leaf, the approach of the
Union forces, and the resolve of Charles
Campbell to save the wounded captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was at the moment when Price was in
pursuit of the Indian that Campbell, taking
advantage of his absence, and observing the
approach of the Federals, hastily penned
the note previously referred to and then
pushed off with the boat, down the stream,
in order to effect his escape with the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c007'>He began to hope that success would
crown his efforts. The battle favored his
flight. All that day and the night following,
he pursued his course. It was his purpose
to follow the Gasconade until he had
reached the point nearest Rolla, where he
supposed he would be free from the roving
bands of rebels, who were so numerous in
the vicinity of Springfield. But his hopes
were doomed to disappointment. Colonel
Price, anticipating the direction he had
taken, immediately dispatched one Lieutenant
Lewis, a most tireless wretch, with a
squad of ten men, to intercept Campbell,
and the prisoner captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as the morning dawned, Campbell
saw the pursuing party approaching. Pulling
for the shore, he lifted Captain Hayward
in his arms, and bore him into a mill,
which stood near at hand. There he quickly
concealed his charge in an upper loft,
and returned to meet the rebels. He stated
he had been captured by a party of the
Federals and conveyed to that point, and
that they had there released him upon his
parole of honor. This story was generally
believed, although one of the band appeared
to be incredulous, and left his fellows for a
pretended search. Not observing his absence,
the remainder of the rebel band returned
without him, taking care, however,
that Campbell was not left behind.</p>

<p class='c007'>When this person entered the mill, he
found Hayward leaning upon his elbow,
quite conscious, but too weak to move. He
paused before the wounded man, and was
silent, Hayward saw, and recognized him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are friends near?” was his feeble question.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am the only friend you have got in
these parts, and I reckon as how ‘ugly Jim’
ain’t just the man you want to see!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are one of my own men!” returned
Hayward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s a p’int as will admit of some argument,
as the lawyers say! I may be <i>your</i>
man when I am in Springfield, but you are
<i>my</i> man now! So don’t kick up any fuss,
and after I have made you fast, I’ll tell you
the rest. Ha, ha!” he muttered to himself,
“but Walker shall pay me well for <i>this</i>!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Saying this the rebel rascal left the mill.
Not far from this mill, in a wretched log-hut,
lived an old woman, who gloried in the
title of “crazy Madge,” and of whom the
rude backwoods people of the vicinity stood
in fear, as it was almost universally believed
among them that she was possessed of the
devil. She told fortunes with great correctness,
and employed the most singular modes
in doing this, such as burning powder and
strange incense, and the uttering of fearful
imprecations, and unearthly sounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mill was owned by one Bohannan,
a captain of Confederate guerrillas. Since
the commencement of the war, it had not
been in operation, except on rare occasions.
About one mile above Bohannan’s mill,
there was another mill, of smaller dimensions,
which had formerly been owned by a
thorough Union man, who, becoming a
refugee, had abandoned this mill, also. So
when the residents in that region, or any of
the straggling rebel bands, had occasion to
grind their grain, they always went to the
upper mill, more especially as it was believed
that “crazy Madge” had taken full
possession of the lower one after its proprietor
left, and that, being occupied in sacrilegious
rites, it was very generally believed
to be unsafe to venture in that vicinity.
Even the most reckless and hardy of the
guerrillas held the spot in awe, and avoided
it at all times.</p>

<p class='c007'>Madge was seated in her own door when
Campbell entered the mill with Hayward in
his arms. She watched him closely, but
uttered no word. She saw him emerge,
and meet the rebel band. She watched their
departure, and then discovered the newcomer,
“Grouse Green,” as he was known.
When he came forth from the mill, Madge
still was seated in the cabin doorway,
smoking her pipe. She did not even raise
her eyes, or pretend the least consciousness
of his presence, until, with a rude slap upon
her shoulder, he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, old woman, I want you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The old creature pretended not the least
surprise, but, raising her snake-like eyes to
those of the speaker, she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does the son of Belial wish to know
his fate? I need not the aid of my magic
charms to point it out to me. In less than
a month, the most horrible death—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bah, you old crone! I’d dash your
brains out for a copper, you infernal croaking
old buzzard! I don’t come to have my
fortune told, but I want you to serve me,
and you shall have gold—do you hear, old
woman? No fooling now, and gold is
yours!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gold! It is the master-key to human
hearts! And what am I to do for gold?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My bidding! First, I want a set of
chains! Have you such things in your infernal
den?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can have them for gold!” she exclaimed,
tottering to a closet, and rattling
the cold iron. “I always keep them—it is
necessary to my trade!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now for the bargain, old hag. You
saw me enter that mill just now? Well,
there is a captain confined, or will be confined
before I leave him, in the upper loft.
He will be fastened. You must feed him
daily, just enough to keep life in him. I
will give you a hundred to start upon—more
money than you ever saw, old woman,
and when I return, if you have well done
your duty as keeper, I will give you another
hundred. Will you be faithful and keep
the prisoner in safety from rescue?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I swear it by my magic art!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bah! blast your art! Swear it by the
gold you will receive, and I’ll believe you.
But come!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Green reëntered the mill followed by old
Madge. He seized the helpless Hayward
and bore him to an upper loft. There he
fettered him with the chains.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now I shall leave you here until
we can attend to you at a more convenient
time!” he muttered, as he gazed exultingly
upon Hayward. He was about to leave him
alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stay but a moment!” cried the wounded
man. “Tell me of my sister!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She has become the wife of Colonel
Brown, of the Confederate army, or, as <i>you</i>
know him, Captain Walker, of the Federals!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Liar!” cried Hayward. “But no! I
will not use such terms now. Do you
know who struck the blow which so nearly
deprived me of life?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; it was William Nettleton! He is
also enlisted in the service of Walker. And
I will tell you more. In two days after you
disappeared, Lieutenant Wells was hung for
your murder. Your sister fled with Walker,
who pretended the greatest friendship
for her. <i>I</i> performed the ceremony, and to-night
they are not three miles from you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hayward had become insensible, and
sunk to the floor. Green saw this, and motioning
to the old woman, they left him
alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is the game I want <i>you</i> to play!”
said Green, as they emerged from the mill.
“Of course, all I have told him is false.
But I want you to carry it out, because
Colonel Price wishes it as well as Walker,
and as he is a most dangerous man to our
cause, I don’t care how poorly he gets along.
It would be a good thing for us if he could
never take the field again. So see that you
do your duty!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Madge received her money, and agreed
to follow all the instructions he had given
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Green now returned at once to the camp,
and reported to Walker. It was just before
the decision of the court-martial had
been given, and that officer was free, not
only from restraint, but from any thing
which had, as yet, assumed a definite form.
He was delighted with the intelligence, and
resolved to take advantage of it soon as
Wells could be thoroughly crushed.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><b>CHAPTER XI.</b><br /> <br /><i>The Prison—The Wheel-room—Caged</i><br /><i>The Life and Death Struggle.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>We</span> left Miss Hayward in the little boat,
in the custody of Walker and stupid Dick.
For several hours they sped rapidly onward
with the stream. They encountered the
party of rebels of which we have made
mention, but, as Walker, or Colonel Brown,
was the officer highest in rank, no one attempted
to interfere with his project. The
boat kept its course until it came upon a
broad flat which appeared to be some five
or six miles in length, and perhaps one in
breadth. This, Walker informed Miss Hayward,
was the “Valley of Bohannan!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And,” said he, “your brother is confined
in yonder mill!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Hayward gazed a moment upon the
structure, and then burst forth in the same
wild strain she had sung so frequently during
her boat voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is folly for you to attempt to attract
his notice by your voice. He is a close
prisoner and a maniac, and nothing but your
constant presence and attention will ever
cause his reason to return!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you intend to do with him
and myself?” asked Miss Hayward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I intend to take you to your brother.
I intend to let you see him in a wretched
garret, with no hope of recovery, or of even
life, unless you come to his aid. I intend
to permit you to <i>gaze</i> upon this scene, but
not even to speak with your brother, or to
assist him in any manner, until you are my
wife. Then you shall be free to attend to
all his wants, to provide for his comfort, to
restore him to reason, to life and to liberty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Hayward bent her head upon her
hands and wept.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will not ask for your final decision
now!” continued Walker. “I will wait
until you have seen your brother, which
will be in a few moments.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The boat was drawn to the shore, and
Walker, turning to Dick, said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will dispense with you now. Go to
Joe’s farm. Follow my instructions as to
storing the house with provisions, and at
least one comfortable bed. Miss Hayward,
it is a beautiful place of which I speak, and,
in case of your refusal to perform all that I
wish voluntarily, or to save your brother, I
shall be compelled to take advantage of a
friend’s mansion, in case I can not effect my
escape with you to Arkansas. This I doubt
being able to do, and more, I don’t know
that I shall run the risk, as I am only a
subordinate, and some of my superiors <i>might</i>
order your release. You perceive that I intend
to make sure of my prize now that
she is in my keeping. As my wife she will
be permitted all proper liberty, but until
you are such, by your own voluntary act,
I must keep you safely from approach by
any one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick had left his master. Walker and
Miss Hayward arrived at the log-hut adjoining
the mill, and entered it. Old Madge
was there, but she looked pale and frightened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come here, Madge. What is the matter?”
asked Walker.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The devil’s broke loose!” replied Madge,
trembling violently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, don’t be alarmed; I am Walker.
I am the one who sent you the hundred
dollars to keep the man safely. You have
done so, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He has just broke loose, and run into
the woods.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did that happen?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, he heard a voice singing outside,
and, in his fever-delirium, said it was an
angel calling him to heaven, and he burst
from his room and rushed up yonder.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Walker and the old woman conversed
together in undertones for a few moments,
when he turned to Miss Hayward and
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your brother, in his delirium, broke his
chains, and is at large in the mountains.
He will not return here, and I think it
doubtful if I can find him. He will, most
likely, make his way to the Federal camps.
But, come with me; you shall see where
he was confined, and then learn my further
intentions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Walker seized the unresisting maiden by
the arm, and drew her into the mill. Up
the dirty stairs she went, and finally entered
the room, or attic, where the unfortunate
brother had been detained prisoner. She
shuddered as she gazed around her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now,” said Walker, “I will show you
<i>your</i> room—one you shall occupy until you
are Mrs. Colonel Brown.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He drew her still further on, and opened
a massive door, which grated upon its hinges.
She gazed in. It was a small apartment
into which the carpenter usually entered
when he wished to repair the great water-wheel
which set the mill in motion. This
room, or rather aperture, was of construction
unlike any apartment intended for occupancy.
There was a platform about ten
feet in width, which formed the only flooring.
Then a great opening beyond, through
which the main wheel extended upward
about eight or ten feet, entirely filling the
opening in the floor. Any man confined
in this apartment would find little difficulty
in effecting his escape, provided he was an
expert swimmer, and the mill not in motion.
But the manner in which an escape must be
effected would be as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>When the mill was running, the wheel
being then in motion, the water was thrown
in large quantities in every part of the
room, and its inmate could scarcely prevent
drowning by catching his breath at intervals.
To attempt to spring into the wheel—which
was formed something like the
wheel of a wagon, the rim, or tire, however,
being about twenty feet in breadth, with
crevices, or brackets, for catching the water
which propelled it, and the braces answering
as spokes bearing proportion to the rim—would
almost assuredly be dashed in
pieces in the attempt to gain the interior.
But, once there, he would be whirled round
and round until he could gather his energies
for a jump when that portion of the
wheel in which he was perched was <i>down</i>,
or nearest the bed of the stream. To leap
out <i>into</i> the river would be a task equally
perilous to that of springing in. When the
wheel was <i>not</i> in motion, one could step
into the opening, slide down the rim with
great ease, spring into the water, and gain
the shore in a moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Hayward gazed into this room or
vault with a fainting, sickening sensation;
but she did not speak. It appeared as if
hope had almost left her heart, now that
she found her brother gone, and she nerved
herself for any fate that might overtake her.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c007'>It was, as we have stated, late in the
afternoon before the rebels encamped around
the stack where Nettleton and Fall-leaf
were secreted, took their departure, and up
to that time the two faithful pursuers were
unable to venture forth. At last all was
safe, and they emerged from their concealment,
and gazed around them. No living
person was to be seen. A meal was hastily
prepared, after partaking of which they resumed
their journey at a rapid rate. All
night they plodded along, taking care to see
that no <i>mill</i> was passed upon the route.
As the morning dawned, they found themselves
in an open space of considerable extent,
and close by the stream was a mill.
This was carefully examined in every nook
and corner; but nothing was found. They
made inquiry of a woman living in a cabin
near the spot, and learned that, a mile further
on, was another mill of larger dimensions,
belonging to one Bohannan. For
this place they immediately bent their steps.
Arriving, they were met by old Madge, who
immediately commenced her mummeries in
order to divert their attention. The Indian
gazed upon her a moment, as if half in awe,
and half in fear, but Nettleton did not pause,
and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come along, Ingen; I expect here’s the
place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They entered the mill. The Indian remained
at the door to prevent any egress,
while Nettleton commenced his search. Up
and down, high and low, the search was
prosecuted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walker being then within, had observed
the approach of Nettleton and the Indian.
His first impulse was to fire upon them;
but he knew if his aim proved inaccurate
he might then bid adieu to life, and so he
resolved to resort to stratagem. He seized
Miss Hayward and sprung into a wheat-bin,
close by the door of the wheel-room we
have described. He soon buried himself
and his prisoner among a lot of old bags,
husks and refuse, and cautioned her to
remain quiet, as a band of Kansas cut-throats,
who regarded neither the life or
person of a pretty woman, were at hand.
This had the effect to keep Miss Hayward
quiet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton had completed his search. The
lower floor of the mill had been carefully
scrutinized—its closets, its bins—except the
small one near the wheel-room, which had
escaped his notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder if there is any thing under
the mill?” queried Nettleton. “I’ll call, and
see if that does any good. Captain! Captain
Hayward!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The voice was at once recognized by
Miss Hayward, who vainly struggled to
reply; but Walker held a handkerchief so
tightly over her mouth that she could produce
no sound. At length, by a desperate
effort, she removed his hand and shrieked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, William! here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where? where?” cried William, as he
sprung toward the bin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>In the wheel-room!</i>” yelled Walker,
smothering his voice so far as to drown the
exact direction in which it came.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton bounded into the wheel-room,
closely followed by the Indian, who now
supposed their friends to be found. Quick
as lightning Walker sprung from the bin,
and slammed the door upon them, bolting it
securely. He then started for the mill-gate,
which, being hoisted, would set the large
wheel in motion.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as the door was closed upon
Nettleton, he rightly suspected treachery,
and throwing himself with all his violence
against the door, tried to force it. But in
vain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quick, Ingen; jump into the mill-wheel,
and down into the water!”</p>

<p class='c007'>They were about to adopt this plan of
escape, when the wheel started with great
rapidity, rendering it seemingly impossible
to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now,” yelled Walker, as he seized Miss
Mamie and bore her from the mill, “you
shall see the folly of opposing me! You
shall see how I triumph over <i>all</i> obstacles,
and how those who oppose me perish!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Inside of the mill, and near the door, was
a quantity of hay and unthreshed grain,
stored there for use by some neighboring
farmer or guerrilla. Striking a match,
Walker lit the inflammable material. In a
moment it blazed high, and communicated
with the woodwork. Walker only waited
to see this, and then, almost dragging Miss
Hayward along, he reached the river, drew
the boat into the stream, and was once more
floating with the current.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look, Miss Mamie, is not that a lovely
sight?” he cried, pointing to the mill, now
thoroughly enveloped in flames. “Nettleton
is there, and Fall-leaf is there, and they
have been brought there by <i>you</i>. They
will perish in those flames, and you must
be responsible for their murder. When
will you learn that it is useless to oppose
me, and cease to do so? To submit to my
proper and honorable requests is the only
way you can save your friends.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When Nettleton and Fall-leaf found their
mode of escape thus cut off, they naturally
turned to each other for advice. But the
water thrown from the wheel so blinded
and choked them that they could not hold
conversation at all. It was not long before
our prisoners became aware of the fact
that, however disagreeable the water might
be, they were likely to be visited by an
element, and that very soon, far more disagreeable,
under the present circumstances.
The flames were seizing upon every part of
the mill, and all around them soon became
a mass of lurid, destroying light. The
rafters, flooring and upper work threatened
to fall at any moment. Still the room in
which our friends were confined remained
unscathed, surrounded as it was by water.
But, it must soon yield to the fiery element.
The wheel still moved; yet it seemed as if
its speed was somewhat lessened. At length
Nettleton yelled:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ingen, I’m going; take your chances!”</p>

<p class='c007'>With a bound he sprung into the wheel.
He escaped any severe blow, but, upon
alighting he was tossed, and pitched, and
tumbled over, until at last, catching upon
the centre-bar, he held himself until he had
made his calculation as to where his next
jump should be. At last he ventured the
hazardous leap, and was precipitated into
the foaming waters beneath the wheel,
which in its revolution struck him lightly,
calling forth a grumble or a grunt. But
Nettleton battled bravely with the rushing
waters, and at length, half dead with suffocation,
he crawled upon the bank as the
burning rafters of the mill were falling
around him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wal, I suppose Ingen is roasted alive,
and I must do the work alone. I’m darn
sorry. And I’ve lost my gun, too. But I
ought to be glad that I didn’t lose myself.
The villain, but won’t I roast him if ever I
lay these hands on him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus he muttered as he sat for a moment
gazing upon the appalling spectacle before
him. He then sprung up, and seeing the
old woman, at once started for the cabin.
Madge met him at the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you have my services, to tell you
truly the fortune that is in store for you?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your services. Yaas; I’ll have you
tell me all about affairs here in this quarter,
and if you don’t own up every thing, I’ll
put you in this pile of logs and roast you,
as sure as you are a she woman. Do you
understand?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have but little to reveal of the circumstances
to which you refer. The Federal
officer <i>was</i> in the mill a prisoner, but
escaped, in his delirium, and is now somewhere
out in the mountain. Walker and
the lady were in the mill, but are now out
of reach, down stream. This is all I
know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And it is enough. Now, you just fork
over a good Minié musket—I know you
have a dozen concealed here for the use of
your friends, and all the fixins for settlin’ the
hash of your friend, Captain Walker, for
him and me has an account to fix what will
require powder and lead, if this bread-cutter
of mine don’t do the job,” he said, handling
his bowie-knife.</p>

<p class='c007'>Madge only too well read in Nettleton’s
face the resolute nature of the man, and
with scarcely a moment’s hesitancy went
out of the hut to a hollow tree near by, and
produced from thence an armful of arms,
made up of shot-guns, old-fashioned rifles,
and a Minié musket. From these Nettleton
selected, after careful scrutiny, a heavy
double-barrel squirrel gun. Ammunition
was also supplied by the woman without
hesitancy, and the pursuer soon found himself
equipped in a most formidable manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There, old gal, you have done the right
thing. It is well that you did, for, as sure
as lizards, I should have burned you in your
pen if you hadn’t forked over what I know’d
was in your possession. Now, good-by,
and behave yourself. If the captain—my
captain I mean—comes back to you, do
you be kind to him, for I tell <i>you</i> it is for
your best interests to be so. Do you believe
that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe any thing you say,” replied the
old creature, betraying her anxiety to get
rid of her visitor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do, eh? Well, jist keep on thinking
so, for I shall, mayhap, want to use you
again some of these days. So good-by, and
keep your eyes clean.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With this injunction he started again for
the river, following the stream for some
distance, but finally, for some reason best
known to himself, took to the mountains.
Every few moments he would pause and
listen, as if a faint sound met his ears, and
then continue his journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>After Nettleton had escaped from the
mill, Fall-leaf began to look around for
some other means of escape. He felt sure
that Nettleton’s leap must be a fatal one—that,
if he was not dashed to pieces by the
wheel, he would surely be drowned in the
rushing waters. All chance of escape for
the poor Indian appeared quite as hopeless.
The flames were already hissing around
him, and curling up the sides of his prison-house.
The fire had weakened the boards,
and, just as the flames were coiling around
his form, he made a desperate effort, and
burst the siding from the mill. In an
instant he sprung through the aperture, although
the fiery element presented a formidable
obstacle between himself and safety.
He alighted, however, with only a few
slight bruises, and, waiting for nothing,
bounded forward. He knew if Walker had
continued his journey down the river, he
could soon overtake him. For an hour he
did not slacken his pace, and finally, in
turning a short bend in the river, he beheld
the boat.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was about to dash forward to the
rescue of Miss Hayward, but he remembered
that he had no gun, his only weapon
being his sheath-knife, while Walker was
well armed. He must resort to stratagem.
His object was to watch for opportunity,
and when Walker should land, or when the
boat neared the shore, and the thicket favored
the movement, to spring upon him
suddenly, and drive the knife to his heart.
But the river gradually grew wider, and
Walker kept his boat in the center, too far
distant from shore for any attempt for his
seizure to prove successful. All that day
and all the night following, the boat drifted
on with the stream. It was evident Walker
was anxious to reach a certain point as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>The morning dawned just as the little
craft shot past the ford on the Rolla turnpike,
near the “ghost swamp,” a locality
of weird interest and novel character.
Walker was about to land, near a small
farm-house which stood behind a jutting
hill, entirely concealed from the main road,
but before touching the shore, his quick eye
caught sight of a dark form creeping cautiously
along the bank. At the same moment
he discovered three horses tied in a
thicket only a short distance from the house.
Whether they belonged to friend or foe he
could not tell; but the fact of seeing the
creeping form rendered him cautious, and
he immediately pulled for the opposite shore,
where he landed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you friend or foe to the Confederates?”
shouted Walker, from the opposite
side of the stream.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no response.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That cursed Dick must have betrayed
me,” he muttered. “But, I will match
them yet. Come!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He dragged Miss Hayward along up the
mountain steep. At length he reached a
point of rock which extended far over the
valley below. A narrow footway, not more
than ten inches in width, forming a kind of
shelf in the rock, led into an immense cavern,
which is known in that region as the
“Silver Cave.” Just in front of this cave
was a large, flat rock, forming an overhanging
platform, but to reach this, or the mouth
of the cave, required great care, as the narrow
path was the only manner in which an
entrance or exit could be effected. Into
this place Walker conveyed Miss Hayward.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walker had, when meeting the rebels
two days before, provided his boat well with
provisions. These he conveyed with him
into the cavern.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had not observed, however, that he
was followed closely, and that the Indian
arrived at the narrow passageway just as
the rebel and his prisoner entered the cave.
This was so. The Indian crept up as closely
as possible, and peered over the projecting
point which shut Walker from his view.
He was observed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And who are you?” yelled Walker.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indian was perfectly familiar with
the cave. He knew no person could leave
it by the narrow shelf or pathway. He
could keep himself concealed, and if Walker
passed a certain point, before he could bring
his gun to bear, he could strike him dead.
Walker was a prisoner, with a watchful and
relentless keeper. The Indian replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, White Bird! Fall-leaf here! Fall-leaf
save!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it indeed my friend Fall-leaf?” cried
Miss Hayward, joyfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; Fall-leaf save you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is William Nettleton?” asked
Mamie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gone—gone!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! then I have only <i>you</i> to encounter,”
yelled Walker, “and, if the Fates favor
me, I shall triumph. I know the Indian
has not thought to provide himself
with provisions. I have enough to last us,
with care, for two weeks, and by that time
he will starve, for no Federal fool ever will
find me <i>here</i>. He dare not leave in search
of help, for I should then effect my escape.
So we will play our hands, and see if I do
not hold the trump card. Ha! ha! I can
baffle any friend you have, Miss Hayward.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“White Bird sing,” said the Indian.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I will sing. And as we are now
near the main road, some one will be sure
to hear me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me watch—me wait!”</p>

<p class='c007'>During the entire passage Miss Hayward
had not failed to sing her echo-song every
few miles, hoping to attract attention and
gain assistance. Now that she was so near
the public highway, she applied herself anew
to the task. Walker made frequent attempts
to silence her, but could not do it, as he
feared, whenever he turned from his watch,
that the Indian would dart in upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some two years previous, there was a
superstitious belief prevailing in that section
of Missouri, that the spirit of a murdered
lady appeared upon the waters of the Gasconade,
singing her mournful lays, and gliding
in her death-skiff along the waters. For
some time past nothing had been heard of
the “lady-ghost;” but, when the songs of
Miss Hayward were heard, the simple inhabitants
began to think that the “ghost-lady”
had returned, and, instead of seeking
to gratify their curiosity, were careful to
keep as far as possible away. So it proved
with regard to the cave, after the singing
commenced.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several days passed, and no succor appeared.
The Indian kept faithful watch,
and so did Walker, that he might not be
taken by surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walker becoming convinced that Fall-leaf
had no gun, several times endeavored
to bring his own to bear upon his vigilant
foe, but this he could not do without placing
himself in a dangerous position. Both
were weary for want of sleep, and both
would occasionally sink into a fitful slumber;
but, so intent was each upon his object,
that the slightest movement would rouse the
sleepers, and each stand ready to meet his
foe. But, as Fall-leaf had no food, he began
to grow faint—his firm frame began
visibly to weaken; still, he determined to
maintain his watch as long as life should
last.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><b>CHAPTER XII.</b><br /> <br /><i>The Mountain Adventure.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Let</span> us return to the army, which we left
near Lebanon. The main force was to continue
its march onward toward Rolla, while
a battalion of infantry, a section of artillery,
and a company of cavalry struck to the
west of the main road, and started for the
point from which the messenger had arrived.
It was a weary march, as the troops already
had proceeded twenty miles that day. But
the dreadful atrocities related as having been
committed by the guerrillas fired the hearts
of the brave soldiers, and they pressed forward
with a will.</p>

<p class='c007'>The troops at last reached the scene of
the outrages, in the place known as “Bohannan
Mills Valley.” The deeds of blood
and horror had not been exaggerated by the
messenger. Women had been murdered in
their beds, old men were lying stiff and cold,
with their brains beaten out, and children,
helpless and weeping, were clinging to their
dead bodies or wandering distractedly around.</p>

<p class='c007'>The battalion which had been sent to this
valley was the one to which Lieutenant
Wells and Adjutant Hinton belonged. Wells
was still suffering from the terrible anxiety
of mind which he had recently undergone,
but did not permit his own troubles to interfere
with his discharge of duty. The troops
camped in the little valley, to collect the
scattered families, whose remaining members
it was determined to take along with the
army in its retreat. Soon word was brought
by a mountaineer that the guerrillas still
were infesting the mountain, while the flames
of a burning mill, seen below, seemed to
give evidence that the miscreants still were
at their work of blood. This decided the
officers to scour the mountain, if possible, to
force the rebels to a fight, for there was not
a man in the Union ranks who did not pant
for a chance to meet those dastards, who, under
the protecting folds of the Confederate
flag, committed atrocities at which humanity
stood aghast. Wells was soon at the head
of a strong party of dismounted dragoons,
and with them struck off for the hills back
of the burning mill. A weary march was
brought to a sudden halt by a deep water
gully, over which no perceptible ford offered
a passage. Up and down it Wells passed
to reconnoiter. It was an ugly spot to be
caught in by a wily foe, and the troops were
so disposed as to guard against a surprise.
The men kept close under cover of the dense
undergrowth, so as not to betray their position
should the guerrillas come upon them.
Lieutenant Wells and Adjutant Hinton were
proceeding up the watercourse, when a rattle
of fire-arms arrested their attention. It
was evident some kind of a conflict was
taking place over the stream. The volley
was not, however, answered by a return;
only a single shot was heard, and then a
wild, frenzied shout, as if of maddened men.
After a brief interval, another shot was
heard, and a second paralyzed howl was
followed by shouts and curses, plainly heard
by the two anxious senior officers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It must be the guerrillas after the poor
Unionists who have fled to the mountain,”
said Hinton. “Our men must not be idle
when such work is going on. You stay
here, Wells, to watch further, while I go
back to bring up our boys.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hinton hurried away, while Wells crept
forward to the very edge of the deep but
narrow gully beyond which the sounds of
conflict were heard. Hardly had he secured
a spot for observation, ere he was startled
by the crash of the undergrowth and the
voices of men not ten rods away. On toward
the lieutenant’s place of concealment
came the pursued and pursuers. The first
was but a single man, whom Wells several
times detected gliding along from tree to
tree, keeping “under cover” like an experienced
woodsman. He was closely pursued
by a band of the guerrillas, all dismounted,
who were making the hills echo with their
demoniac yells. Slowly the fugitive retired,
holding his foes at bay by his sagacious maneuvers.
Wells became intensely excited
over the scene, and resolved to rush at once
to the brave fellow’s aid, but there lay before
him the impassable gulf over which
few men could bound. Finally the hunted
man struck the gully, and saw at a glance
that his retreat was cut off. The enemy
saw it, too, for they set up a shout of commingled
derision and pleasure, which so
maddened the fugitive that he yelled:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Laugh away, you darn skunks. I’ll
make more than one of your dirty carcasses
food for the crows before I go under.” And
suiting the words to action, he fired two
successive shots from what, apparently, was
a double-barrel fowling-piece. Two of the
guerrillas must have fallen, for ferocious
shrieks of agony followed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wells could endure no more. There
stood before him his brave friend William
Nettleton, hunted by a dozen fiends who
must soon overpower him if aid was not
quickly given. He started backward for a
couple of rods, then rushed with almost flying
swiftness up to the gully, and bounded
over its sharply-cut edge. For a moment
his desperate leap arrested all attention.
Nettleton deemed it a new adversary coming
upon him from an unexpected quarter,
and turned, knife in hand, to close in with
his antagonist. What was his astonishment
to welcome Lieutenant Wells to his arms!
What a shout followed! The guerrillas
quickly sought cover, not knowing how
many others might be lurking on the opposite
side of the ravine to give them a
bloody welcome.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wells, by the jumping jingo! Where
<i>did</i> you come from and where <i>is</i> you going
to? Give us yer hand and lend us yer revolver.
Ah, got two of ’em. <i>Hooray!</i>
Down on yer knees quicker’n lightnin’, for
the woman-murderers are after us, sharp!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Down the two men fell, just in time to
escape a volley from the carbines of a squad
of the murderers. With the dexterity of a
squirrel, Nettleton rushed forward to a
friendly tree, and fired quickly three shots
from the revolver. It was a surprise to the
enemy, for two of their number fell, so true
had the aim been. The squad retreated to
reload, but Nettleton had no idea of permitting
that, and was about to press his advantage,
when a powerfully-built rebel came
rushing upon him, knife in hand, from the
right side of the tree, unseen by the undaunted
man until it was too late for the
use of his fire-arm. In a moment they were
clasped in the death-struggle. Three or
four of the guerrillas rushed to the spot,
only to be shot down by Wells’ deliberate
aim. No more appeared, and the two combatants
were left to their fearful work.
Each had seized the knife-hand of the other.
Then followed the strain of muscle for the
mastery. The guerrilla, counting upon his
tremendous strength, doubtless hoped for
an easy victory; but in that ungainly form
he found a bundle of nerves tough as whale-bone—a
human frame elastic as india-rubber
but as invincible as steel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Down toward the gully the combatants
pressed. In vain did the rebel try to force
his antagonist to the earth. The supple
form of Nettleton bent under his adversary’s
pressure, but his frame at length rebounded
with a force which bore the guerrilla
to his knees. He drew the Federal
down with him, and on their knees the
frightful combat was continued. Wells
would have advanced from his concealment
to the rescue, but knew that a rebel carbine
would surely bring him down, and thus
place it out of his power to aid his friend
at all. Slowly toward the chasm the men
worked their way, struggling like two serpents
striving for the death-triumph. It
was an exciting but appalling spectacle,
which the sudden roar of fire-arms on the
left did not serve to arrest. A shout followed,
which Wells recognized as that of
his own men, who must have discovered a
crossing below, and have come upon the
band of cut-throats unawares. There was
a sudden scattering of those concealed in
the immediate vicinity of the hand-to-hand
contest, but one villain rushed from his
cover upon the writhing forms of the bleeding
men, with the design of dispatching the
unconquered Federal. Wells was upon
him like a tiger, and in a moment cut him
down with his sword. Hinton beheld the
stroke, and came rushing up to the spot
just in time to behold the struggling men
go over the gully’s bank together.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two officers hurried to the bank.
Some twenty feet below they could distinguish
the forms of the combatants, both apparently
lifeless. Without a moment’s hesitancy,
Wells dropped from the brink, and
fell crashing through the dense jungle lining
the water’s edge, to the bed of the stream.
He was stunned but not injured, and arose
to his feet to find Nettleton in a sitting posture.
Beside him lay the big guerrilla,
silent in death.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll be danged if that wan’t the ugliest
cuss as ever I tusseled with, breeches-holt,
back-holt or rough-and-tumble.” This was
his first ejaculation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you injured?” anxiously inquired
Wells.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wal, let’s take a reconnoissance. Here’s
a hole in this arm, that’s sp’iled the only
good coat I ever had, dang it! Here’s a
rip, too, in the collar, whar that critter’s
knife tried to cut my windpipe. He <i>did</i>
scratch me thar, I believe,” he said, fingering
his neck, down which the blood flowed
freely. “By Jemima, ef I haven’t lost a
finger!” he added, suddenly holding up his
hand. “Now, that’s too bad, ef it is on
the left hand. I rayther think the reb got
a mouthful when he chawed that off!”
And thus he would have continued for another
ten minutes had not shouts from above
aroused him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who’s come?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hinton and the battalion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Glory! And have the rebs been caught
in a trap?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know how many, but from the
shots and shouts I don’t think many will be
permitted to escape.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right. Now jist give us a lift, to
see if my shanks is all right. There, that’s
the juniper. Jist look at my back, and see
if you find any holes that want plugging.”</p>

<p class='c007'>No “holes” were found, and the good-natured
fellow came out of the combat
with only flesh-wounds, save the loss of one
finger from the left hand, which the guerrilla
had bitten off. Nettleton was much
exhausted, and was finally drawn up out of
the gully with no little difficulty, when the
men set up a shout which made the hills
ring.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There, boys, that’ll pay for the bruises;
and now I guess you’ll have to do me another
favor—jist rub my shanks and the
hinges in my back with a little whisky, if
you can spare it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In a moment a dozen pocket-flasks were
produced and willing hands gave him a good
rubbing, which gave his limbs new strength.
It was evident that his muscles had been
severely overtasked, for he was languid and
incapable of exertion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton now narrated the particulars
of his and Fall-leaf’s adventures. Soon the
troops were out on the search for Captain
Hayward, while, assisted by a couple of
comrades, the wounded hero of the hour
made his way down to the cabin of old
Madge. The old creature received him
kindly and at once bestirred herself to make
him strong again. The air was soon odoriferous
with the smell of distilling herbs.</p>

<p class='c007'>A prolonged shout, ere long, came rolling
down the hill. Nettleton was aroused from
a sleep into which he had fallen. His two
comrades at once hurried out to ascertain its
cause. Old Madge paused in her toil and
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The captain’s found, I s’pose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hooray!” yelled the invalid, now an invalid
no longer. Springing from his bed
he rushed out, and away he went up the
hills in the direction of the still continuing
noise. His companions, astonished at his
sudden recovery, followed, and all were soon
lost to sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Harry Hayward was indeed found, and
the cavalcade, bearing him on a rude litter,
after a half-hour’s time, made its appearance
coming down the mountain. Nettleton was
at his side, crying like a baby. Wells held
the sick man’s hand, while his face, still expressing
anxiety, beamed with joy. Hayward
was discovered hidden in a quiet, cool
nook, where he lay in a very exhausted condition.
He had, in his fever-delirium, broken
away from Madge’s custody, but, no
sooner was he out in the cool shade of the
trees and rocks than his mind became clear
and composed. Weak and ill as he was he
still had strength to seek a place of safety
from pursuit, should it be attempted, as he
supposed it would be. At nightfall he had
determined to seek out some respectable
looking farm-house, and on the morrow to
cast himself upon the mercy of strangers,
knowing that even though that stranger
might be a foe he could not be more inhuman
than men wearing the uniform of Confederate
officers. But the sufferer was spared
further efforts. The shouts and reports of
fire-arms Hayward distinctly heard, and at
once surmised that a Union force was at
hand. When the men scattered in squads
for the search through the mountain, the
captain beheld one of the parties passing
before his hiding-place. It was his moment
of deliverance. He stepped out before the
astonished soldiers, who, not recognizing
the apparition, did not at once welcome
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My men, don’t you know me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Captain Hayward!” they shouted, as
they rushed upon him, and clasped him in
their arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was borne toward Madge’s cabin, to
be welcomed on the way by the gathering
men. Wells now appeared. The joy of
that meeting can be surmised. The welkin
was made to ring with the glad notes of
the jubilant soldiers. These notes it was
which aroused the sleeper in the cabin, and
when at length he appeared, struggling
wearily up the hill, the cavalcade paused to
permit the overjoyed parties a few minutes
of undisturbed greeting. Nettleton was
not even talkative—a circumstance indicative
of the depth of his feelings—and it
was not until the captain was fully domiciled
in the cabin, that he could consent
to talk of the past and its painful
incidents. He then narrated the events of
Walker’s plot, as we have here recorded
them, ending with the tragedy of the mill.
It was a revelation of intense but most
painful interest to the sick man; but he
bore the affliction of his sister’s loss with
great resolution, sustained by the conviction
that He who doeth all things well would
not permit the evil one to triumph.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><b>CHAPTER XIII.</b><br /> <br /><i>The Cave and the Contest for Life.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>After</span> two days spent in the cabin, Nettleton
became excessively uneasy. From
something which had transpired, he conceived
that old Madge knew more of
Walker’s whereabouts than she had yet
confessed. This conviction, once formed,
was but the prelude to action. Without
informing any one of his purpose, he followed
the old woman into the woods—whither
she went in pursuit of her medicaments—having
in his hands a stout rope.
In a wild, retired spot, he confronted her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look here, old critter, you’re close-mouthed,
when it would be better for your
health to talk a little. Now, you jist tell
me where Captain Walker has taken Miss
Mamie. Talk straight, and not a gap in
the fence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know where he has gone,” she
answered, rather evasively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is, you are a nat’ral-born know-nothing.
Well, it will assist your memory,
perhaps, to stretch your neck a little, jist to
take the kinks out, you know; so pass your
shock of tow into this ’ere noose, while I
pull you up on that limb.” And suiting the
action to the word he flung the noose dextrously
over her head. She was taken by
surprise, and trembling in every limb,
asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Would you hang me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sartain as there’s a tree and here’s a
rope.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know where Walker is, but I
think he has a place of refuge down the
river, near the Ghost Swamp. There is a
cave in the river’s bank, opposite to the
swamp, where I know his confederates occasionally
secrete themselves. He may have
gone there; but, as he has been gone over
two days, I don’t see why he should be
there now. It is my opinion, however, that
Miss Mamie, as you call her, is there, as it
is the best place to keep her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, thank you, old Mrs. Crow’s-foot.
There is something more on your mind,
isn’t there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Madge looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know all about your friend’s visit; so
do you jist play your cards right, or I’ll
catch ye niggin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This allusion to her “friend” startled the
old woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was no friend of mine; he came
along on his own account, and I only gave
him bread, as I give any one who is
hungry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right; only, what did he tell you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She hesitated. Nettleton gave the rope
a twitch, and looked up at the limb. The
hint was enough.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The man said he was up from below on
a scout. He was anxious to know what I
knew about the voice of a woman which
he said had been heard all along the river.
He heard it distinctly as he passed the road
along the river by the Ghost Swamp;
others had heard it, and he believed that I
could tell him as to its meaning. I told
him it was a sign that he was singled out
for death—that every person who heard it
was called, and he might, therefore, make
up his mind that his time was come. With
that he left. I did not inform him of who
was in my cabin, nor any thing about what
had happened here. So I hope you will
let me go, and frighten me no more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton slowly lifted the noose from
her neck, and, without another word,
walked back to the cabin. He called out
Lieutenant Wells, who was then watching
at the captain’s bedside, and the two friends
held a long consultation together, which
ended by an order for a guard of twenty to
be ready for a night expedition.</p>

<p class='c007'>By ten o’clock all were in readiness and
on their way, taking the river path down
stream. Wells was in command. Nettleton
acted as scout and guide. All night
long they pressed on, and daylight
found them on the hills opposite the spot
indicated by Madge as the locality of the
cave in the bank. Asking Wells for his
field-glass, Nettleton carefully scrutinized the
river’s bank opposite. After a short survey
he suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>The Ingen</i>, as sure as Sacramento!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you say?” inquired Wells.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fall-leaf—see him—there he lays, and
there is the cave. I’m blest if I know what
to make of it. I supposed, <i>of course</i>, that
that red-skin was roasted alive in the mill;
but there he is, and here I goes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So saying, down he dashed into the river,
and forded its waters rapidly. Once on the
opposite side, he hurried up the bank, and
soon reached the ledge across which the
Indian was lying. The poor fellow was
but half conscious from over-fatigue and
hunger, yet his eyes were fixed with cat-like
vigilance upon the aperture of the cave,
while his hand still firmly clasped the knife
upon which he relied to do his deadly
work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton approached him silently, and
touched his feet. At once the Indian looked
behind him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give Fall-leaf drink—quick!” was his
hurried whisper, while the finger on his lip
indicated silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nettleton comprehended all at a glance.
Passing his canteen and knapsack to Fall-leaf,
he beheld the Indian drink and eat
with satisfaction. Not a word passed between
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good! Fall-leaf <i>much</i> weak; now strong
again,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where’s Miss Mamie?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indian pointed to the cavern.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Walker, too?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Fall-leaf nodded, and scowled so fiercely
that Nettleton perceived the savage wanted
no interference in his case.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shan’t I do the job for ye?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No—Fall-leaf <i>mad</i>. Me kill ’em—you
go way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s the talk, Ingen. You shall have
your man; but, Jerusalem, don’t I ache to
git my paws on him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>A noise was now heard in the cave; it
was Walker’s voice. “I’ll not permit you
to sing, I again tell you. If those men
crossing the river are Union soldiers, you
shall not betray our whereabouts, and if
Fall-leaf moves I’ll shoot him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bah, you ornery cuss; <i>I’m</i> on your
track now!” shouted Nettleton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“William—dear William!” cried the captive
woman, recognizing his voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Here!</i>” he responded, “and so chock
full of the devil that if I don’t get rid of it
soon it will spile me. Walker, you dirty
beast, dare you fight me?” he yelled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I dare fight any decent antagonist, but
don’t care to dirty my hands with you,”
was the reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you nasty, miserable, thievin’
woman-stealer, man-assassinator. I’ll cook
your breakfast for you, but Fall-leaf shall
eat it; <i>he’ll</i> dirty his hands with <i>you</i>!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I defy you and all your crew,” growled
the rebel. “If one of you dares to show
your head, you are a dead man!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Blast yer picter, here’s a head—shoot
it!” cried Nettleton, sticking his head out
in a manner to dare Walker’s fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>The scoundrel was prepared, and discharged
his gun in an instant. Its report
had not ceased its echo ere Fall-leaf, with a
bound like a panther, dropped before the
entrance of the hole. Walker stood there
with knife in hand, to foil any such attempt
to storm his castle. A quick blow with his
foot sent the Indian headlong over the
ledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Try that on me,” roared Nettleton, who,
uninjured by the ball from Walker’s musket,
was at the Indian’s heels.</p>

<p class='c007'>No sooner said than done, and Nettleton
received an unexpected blow in the bowels
from the rebel’s heavy boot which sent him
almost instantly over the ledge after Fall-leaf.</p>

<p class='c007'>That was the propitious moment for
escape. Without a word to his captive, he
passed out upon the ledge, and had nearly
reached its terminus when Lieutenant Wells,
followed by his men, confronted the desperate
man. Drawing his revolver, Wells
cried:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Surrender or you are a dead man!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never will surrender to you,” was the
fierce reply, as the now cornered desperado
began slowly to retire, backward, to regain
his stronghold.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had retreated fully half-way to the
entrance, when his heel caught in the rough
floor of the ledge, and his balance was
lost. For a moment he sought to regain
his foothold, but, finding it gone, he gave a
shout and leaped over the precipice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The soldiers looked over the ledge and
saw his form disappear in the trees beneath.
Wells did not wait, but rushed to the cavern
mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Mamie.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A form darkened the passage, and within
stood Miss Hayward, smiling and blushing
as if just caught at her toilet.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a cry of joy Wells entered and
clasped her to his bosom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Safe and uninjured! Thank God—thank
God!” answered the maiden.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Safe and restored; and, thank God,
your brother, too, is recovered, and is now
in our hands, doing well!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I am happy, indeed!” she could
only reply, while tears of joy checked further
utterance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wells had entirely forgotten Walker, in
his moment of sweet communion with his
restored friend. But, a shout which came
up from the depths below recalled him to
duty. It was a wild Indian war-whoop;
then a succession of ejaculations which the
men could plainly distinguish.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go in, Ingen!” “Walk along, Walker,
you darn skunk you!” “There, that’s a good
un, Ingen!” “Now another in the corn-crib!”
“There he goes!” “Hooray for the
Ingen!”</p>

<p class='c007'>All well knew the meaning of this, and
a number of the men hastened to the base
of the cliff, by a long, roundabout path,
which came up from the river at the ford
below. They arrived to find Walker slain,
and Fall-leaf badly cut in the face, arms
and shoulders, but no serious wounds on
the body. Nettleton stood over his friend,
bathing his wounds in the clear waters of
the river.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ingen’s done for the cut-throat, sure.
It was mean to shut me out; but it was his
game, ’cause he treed it. I’d give all I’ll
ever be worth—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Would you give Sally?” put in one of
the men.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dang Sally—no, dang my skin—that
is, dang me if I wouldn’t give my commission,
boys, that’s it! give my commission to
have had the satisfaction of doin’ Fall-leaf’s
work.” Nettleton looked savagely at the
body of the dead man, seeming to feel that
he had made a personal sacrifice in permitting
the Indian to kill his enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would appear that both Fall-leaf and
Nettleton, when kicked off the ledge, fell at
its foot without injury, as the base was
banked up to a considerable distance with
the decayed and water-soaked <i>débris</i> of the
bank, down which they rolled into the
water. They had recovered, and stepped
out into the stream to look up to the ledge,
when they beheld Wells and Walker confronted.
In a moment the rebel staggered,
and went bounding off the ledge, and, like
his two antagonists, came tumbling and
sliding down the declivity, landing at the
water’s brink upon his feet. There he was
received by the Indian, with the wild
whoop which startled those above. Nettleton,
in honor bound not to interfere, stood
by while the two fierce foes closed in deadly
conflict. Walker, though a resolute and
strong man, was not equal in a knife fight
to the supple savage. After a few passes,
Fall-leaf buried his knife in the rebel’s
bosom. Thus closed the career of a bad
man—bad by nature, but rendered doubly
bad by the cause which he espoused. To
serve that cause he had to betray his country,
desert his friends, stifle the voice of
conscience, perjure his honor, become a
hypocrite and a deceiver: after that, all
other degrees of crime were easy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wells followed the men at length, and
appeared on the spot. He was shocked at
the sight before him, but conceded its justice.
His own wish was to have secured
Walker for trial and punishment according
to military law; yet, it must be acknowledged
that, many times, he felt like wreaking
condign personal vengeance on the
head of the man who had wrought so successfully
in crime. He ordered the body
to be buried in the <i>débris</i> at the foot of the
cliff; and there it reposes to-day, with no
monument save the cave above, which will
long remain as a witness to the traitor’s
crime and traitor’s doom.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'><b>CHAPTER XIV.</b><br /> <br /><i>The Body-Guard’s Sickness and Cure.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Slowly</span> the party wended its way back to
the mill. Just at nightfall it came in sight
of the lowly hut which covered the treasure
so dear to the heart of the rescued maiden.
How her eager arms longed to clasp her
brother’s form to her bosom—how her ears
longed for the sound of his voice! The
wings of the swallow would have been
slow for her pining soul; but the moment
of reunion came at last—the dead was
made alive, the lost restored. Miss Hayward,
gallanted by Wells, pressed on ahead
of the troop, and their panting steeds at
length stood riderless before the cabin-door,
for the riders had disappeared within.</p>

<p class='c007'>The meeting of brother and sister was
one of mingled pleasure and pain. Both
had suffered so much that to think of it
was pain. Captain Hayward was greatly
emaciated. Loss of blood, fever, hunger
and exposure would have ended a life less
tenacious than his; but, despite his suffering,
the presence of friends, the rescue of his
sister, the anticipated happiness of her union
with the man who had proven himself so
well worthy of her—all conspired to give an
elasticity to his spirits more potent than the
infusions of herbs prepared by the not unskilled
hands of old Madge, who, from an
enemy, had, “by the force of couldn’t help
herself,” as Nettleton declared, become a
useful instrument at a critical moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>And what about Nettleton? All day
long after the morning’s experience at the
cave, he had plodded on soberly, somewhat
absorbed in his own reflections. Behind
him sat Fall-leaf, who, from his weak state,
was well content to ride. The Indian,
though perfectly silent and apparently indifferent
to all things, now that his work was
done, still was inwardly pleased at the rescue
and the thought of the pleasure in store
for the captain, of whose safety he had been
informed by Nettleton; and he was quite
willing to go into camp for a few days
before putting out again on his endless
scouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nettle be sick?” he at length asked of
his companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not by a darn sight, Ingen?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nettle <i>be</i> sick—Fall-leaf knows it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You be danged to darnation, you red
onion-head of a Delaware!” was the somewhat
excited answer, as he turned in the
saddle and stared the Indian in the face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fall-leaf smiled. “Nettle want physic—Miss
Long give Nettle physic,” he obstinately
persisted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now look here, Mr. Ingen, ef you wants
to fight, jest you say so, and I’ll be catawampussed
ef I don’t lick you wuss’n a
nigger what’s got a mad woman arter
him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fall-leaf no want to fight Nettle. Maybe
whip Nettle—den what Miss Long
say?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yoh—yoh! you mean, sneakin’ son of
a brick-kiln! Ef you don’t stop that clapper
in your head, I’ll be switched ef I don’t
put a peg through it!” And he set his
face firmly to the front, roweled the horse
severely with his spurs, and dashed ahead
at a speed quite uncomfortable to the provoking
Delaware.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the cavalcade reached the cabin,
Nettleton did not obtrude himself upon the
party within. For an hour or more they
were alone. At length Hayward asked:
“Where is my brave preserver? Why is he
not here to enjoy our happiness? And
Fall-leaf, too; I would thank him as he deserves,
the noble and devoted savage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Search was made. Fall-leaf was found
out by the camp-fire, undergoing the process
of the lotion-cure for his wounds, at the
hands of Madge, who was carefully washing
the bruised and cut flesh of the red-man.
All inquiries for Nettleton were fruitless;
he was not to be found. It was ascertained,
at length, that his horse also was gone.
Many were the surmises as to the cause of
his absence, and fears were expressed for his
safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morning came, and the party, now rejoined
by the entire battalion, prepared to
move, by easy stages, from the valley toward
the line of march pursued by the
retreating army. Captain Hayward was
made quite comfortable in a camp-wagon,
with his sister for companion and nurse.
Fall-leaf pushed out far ahead to scout and
secure the command from surprise. Adjutant
Hinton and Wells were tireless in their
devotion to the comfort and safety of their
charge. It was a pleasant journey—that
week of slow progress toward Tipton. At
length, however, the village hove in sight.
The white tents dotting the hills and valleys
proved that the division was there.
While yet a long way off, a party of horsemen,
accompanied by ladies, was seen
dashing off at full speed toward the spot
where the battalion had halted for its noon
bivouac. Wells caught sight of the party,
and with his glass made out the gaunt form
of Nettleton far in advance. Behind him
on the same horse rode a female, whose
identity the officer could not fix. Nearer
and nearer the horsemen came, until, after
an exciting race, they dashed into the
camp—Nettleton and Sally Long! They
were received with a wild huzza from the
entire troop, and none shouted louder than
Nettleton himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hooray! hooray! By the eternal jingo!”
he cried, leaping from the horse, and leaving
Miss Sally sitting there alone, before the
eyes of the joyous and excited troops.
Making his way to the captain’s “marquee”—as
the men had named the wagon—he
was welcomed by Hayward in a manner
which quickly turned his servant’s joy to
mourning, for the embrace of real affection
bestowed quite upset Nettleton’s confidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m nothin’ but a great darn skunk, any
how!” he exclaimed, as, breaking away
from the captain’s embrace, he started for
his horse and the neglected Sally.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nettle be sick!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He turned to behold Fall-leaf gazing
upon him in mock compassion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not by a danged sight, you infernal
lump of glory!” he now shouted, as, clasping
the Indian in his arms, he gave the red-man
a hug which brought forth a grunt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ugh! Nettle make Fall-leaf sick!
Guess Nettle got full of Miss Sally now!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sar; and thar she is, in all her
glory!” was the rejoinder, as the “body-guard”
pointed, in evident pride, to the
smiling woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gentlemen of the jury! let me present
to you my wife—the dangdest sk— no, the
most blissful woman you ever saw.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your <i>wife</i>!” exclaimed a dozen voices
at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, my wife! Hitched to me tighter’n
a handle to the jug, by Chaplain Disbrow,
two days ago, by the eternal jingo!”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was enough for the men. All order
gave way before the hilarious uproar which
followed. They pressed around Sally to
offer their congratulations, which the delighted
wife received with great good-nature
and dignity, still sitting where she had been
left—behind the saddle, on the horse.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment the party first descried
rode up. It was composed of Mrs. Hinton,
Miss Morton and a number of friends eager
to welcome the captain and his sister, of
whose fortunes Nettleton had most unexpectedly,
three days before, brought the news
to camp. That it was a joyous meeting
may well be assumed.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c007'>Does not our story here end? To say
that Miss Mamie Hayward soon became
Mrs. Wells, in the presence of the whole
division—that a grand gala-day followed—is
but half the truth, however; for, at the
same time, another bridegroom was there in
the form of the pale but happy Captain
Henry Hayward, who took to be his comforter
and his much-needed nurse, the
woman who loved him most truly—Miss
Nettie Morton. It was, indeed, a most
happy consummation of a drama which
promised, at one time, to end only in sorrow
and broken hearts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not the least happy of all that throng,
nor the least noted, was</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
